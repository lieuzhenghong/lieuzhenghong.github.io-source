Really in a blink of an eye 3 months can pass just like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have I been doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January I went on a trip to Cebu with my JC class. For only 1018 dollars I managed to get a diving license (although the license has yet to arrive after two months). It was a very good 9-day (or was it 8 days?) trip where I had nice food and got to try foods like Balut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving was a really good experience and I want to go again, I will probably want to invest in a mask with prescription though because I couldn’t see shit until the sardine run dive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that traveling with a big group is not easy because different people have different wants. Nonetheless, the trip went relatively smoothly and I felt that I got closer with a few people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 23 I started the internship at iGlobe.
I think there is room for me to do more work.
This week will be the 2-month mark at iGlobe. I have been fortunate enough to be able to sit in for many meetings with investees and am learning a lot about different startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a form letterer for iGlobe. Unfortunately, I predict that the uptake will be quite minimal. 
I’m not sure. Have to make it as easy to use as possible because the biggest obstacle to adoption is simply user laziness.
&lt;strong&gt;Update 31st March&lt;/strong&gt; Finished building the app and I may write a post about it. We’ll see. I’m the only one using it now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, I started on Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning MOOC. Have finished about 3/4th of it right now, and aim to revisit it soon…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March was scholarship season and I have put the MOOCs on hold. I plan to resume in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;scholarship-overview&quot;&gt;Scholarship overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-progress&quot;&gt;Current progress:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JTC: Rejected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MAS: 2/4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GIC: 2/4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CAAS: 0/4 (went for first round, now waiting for result)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IMDA, PSC, EDB: Pending (not heard from them)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IE: forgot about it tbh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mas-scholarship&quot;&gt;MAS Scholarship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went for the first round of the MAS scholarship where we were tasked to write an essay about the two things I would change about Singapore and why. Then I had to take a psychometric test which was easy-peasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just came back from the second round of interview from MAS. I’m not sure if I will hear back from them. (Update 30 Mar: I did, third round is on Monday, 3 Apr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the interview, I got to talk with a HR rep, Henry. Henry said that there were about 600+ applicants this year. They chose 150 for the first round. Out of those 100, 30-40 are in this secondround. When the fourth round begins, there are about eight candidatesand they will finally award the scholarship to 4-6 candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He confirmed that some years MAS does award 0 or 1 scholarships and in the distant past, more than 10 years ago, they awarded 10+ scholarships. The range nowadays is 4-6 though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evidently a very selective process. Even now, I have only a 10%of getting the scholarship if we look at the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the interviewers asked if I had any questions for them I asked for their feedback on my preformance and what I could do to improve. They were quite taken aback by this question and one person commented that I was the first to ask them that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewer said that she liked my candour because when they first asked me why MAS I just said that if I don’t get a scholarship I can’t go to Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two interviewers commented that in the future I should come prepared with an example of an MAS policy and be ready to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HR person said that my mind spin too fast and my mouth cannot catch up. Sometimes I will leave the thread of one argument hanging and jump to the next one. And spoke too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the suggestions they had for improvement. I will definitely prepare more for future interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them did say it’s obvious that I have a bright future and to keep in touch even if I don’t get the scholarship. (He quickly clarified that this does not impute anything about whether I had gotten the scholarship). But I’m pretty sure that this is something they say to every single candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I think I made a pretty unique impression (whether it was a &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; impression is something else entirely). It could have gone better. It was a long interview though, one hour long, and my legs were shaking at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jtc-scholarship-short-and-perfunctory&quot;&gt;JTC scholarship: short and perfunctory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JTC scholarship interview was a group interview with 3 members of HR. They asked us rather silly questions like “what do you think of cyberbullying” and I was like diao… come and ask this kind of question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was quite funny when they asked us what scholarship we are applying for/ what scholarships we want to apply for and all of us basically just listed out macam shopping list like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They rejected me very swiftly—the evening of the interview, in fact—and at the risk of sounding sour grapes, I don’t think JTC would have been right for me, either. So no great loss there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take much courage but I was able to get numbers of my fellow scholarship applicants, Jerry, Engracia and Jazreel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to talk about this right now but I think there is a fine line between pushing and jioing. It’s important to walk this line right and sometimes it may be easy to overstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caas-scholarship&quot;&gt;CAAS scholarship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met Bryce at the CAAS scholarship. CAAS scholarship was pretty fun, I liked it a lot. We weretasked to roleplay as civil servants of CAAS and there were two parts. First part was a debate on proposed legislature regulating drones and the other part was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gic&quot;&gt;GIC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 28th of March I went for the GIC interview. It was great that Mrs Hauw introduced me to Phionna who was able to allay somewhat my anxiety regarding the interview. I was interviewed by two people who were Yen Chen and… someone else I unfortunately forgot the name of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked me why I chose PPE given my interest in tech, about my work in iGlobe and similar questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also asked me three rather pointed questions. First, they asked to tell them about the greatest risk I have ever taken, to which I answered my choice to take ELL instead of Econs inJ1. Then they asked me about a time where I failed and I told them about my NS experience. Lastly, they asked what my greatest weakness was (I joked with them that my greatest weakness is that I’m too long winded, interviewers always tell me to hurry up) and I answered that I can be too blunt and I can be too honest. I volunteered my Malay Special Program experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common comment was that they really appreciated my candiness/candour but they were still uncertain whether i was 100% into the job itself. At MAS they were worried about whether I would be able to do the drudgery and at GIC they said that the work at iGlobe doesn’t necessarily reflect the work I will be doing at GIC, which will be more spreadsheets and stuff and less startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-stuff&quot;&gt;Other stuff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc has really changed a lot after going for his internship. Among other things he has taught me about the importance of being assertive and charismatic. We made a promise to each other to seize oppportunities for daygame, really talk to other people, I have been trying to do so but not entirely successfully. I did miss out yesterday at the gym, there was a pretty girl and I didn’t get to talk to her although I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been making some gains in the gym but it’s predominately bench gains because God knows it’s the only lift I program properly… it’s harder to progress with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that plans for going on a trip with the 6 offenders are finally in the works. We have bought the tickets and Nauxiy and I have planned a more-or-less fixed itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lieuzhenghong</name></author><category term="progress report" /><summary type="html">Wah.

done. I started this blog (I think it’s more of a diary really) for the express
purpose of keeping track of what I have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calendar-of-events-2016&quot;&gt;Calendar of events 2016&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diary/blog has been a great help in remembering the things that I’ve done
this past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-have-succeeded-at&quot;&gt;Things I have succeeded at&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaining-programming-skill&quot;&gt;Gaining programming skill&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I’ve focused on improving my technical skill. I feel that I have
learned a lot but there’s still a billion things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My focus this year has been on the Web and I don’t think that’s a bad thing &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;
because the Web is so ubiquitous after all. However,
after taking CS50 and doing some C, I realise that it can be a lot of fun. I
think I want to move away from building websites as it has become somewhat trivial
with the advent of excellent front-end frameworks like Bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still enjoy
game and app development and am likely to continue pursuing it in the future but 
after dipping my toes in CS50 I think I would like to explore the more technical/
computer science aspect of development. That means ML/NN/AI/compilers? instead
of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will run through this year’s projects each in chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-blog&quot;&gt;This blog&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-explanatory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Github Pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buying a domain name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configuring DNS settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first technical project of 2016. Building a website was not new to me but
using frameworks and build tools to build a website was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time my approach to building a site was to whack &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; files (have been doing it since Sec One), and they’ve never been
hosted under a custom domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automated-transaction-tracker&quot;&gt;Automated transaction tracker&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An app built during NS for WITS made to solve the problem of overdue
loans. It is basically a digital 12-11 record/digital loan book that
tracks who made what loans and sends SMS messages to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system supports user auth and multiple stores. Supervisors can
create stores and invite storemen users to contribute to that store.
Only invited users can see and modify transactions of a store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a front-end UI for users to access through their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately nobody wanted to use it as it was simply
extra work (but I still got Silver).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building a REST app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ExpressJS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MongoDB and Mongoose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deploying on DigitalOcean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twilio API and how to send SMSes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User authentication (token-based)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JSON Web Tokens (JWT)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hashing and salting passwords&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General back-end concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the largest project of 2016! It was an extremely ambitious and extremely
tiring project. I had a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trouble with it although now, looking back, it
seems pretty trivial. (More on this phenomenon next time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing all the Express routers/routes was hard, the MongoDB database queries
even harder, and the React UI hardest of all! It was this project that made me
realise that back-end is actually not hard and much more fun than the front-end.
This was a watershed moment as previously the back-end was something extremely
mysterious and inaccessible to me; I remember in 2015 I had no idea what Dae Koon
was doing when we were doing the Smart Gallery app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;charge-bot&quot;&gt;Charge Bot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A telegram bot that allows two players to play the childhood game of
Charge. It is basically a while loop running on a Heroku instance
that long polls the Telegram server for updates. (it is not a server,
it is a client)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Telegram Bot API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long polling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More REST practice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deploying on Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built this simple Telegram bot a couple months after the Bot API was released.
The moment the Bot API was announced CKY and I immediately discussed building a 
bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extremely simple Telegram bot that took a deceptively long time to do. 
I must admit that the concept
of long polling gave me a lot of grief: I had initially implemented my long polling
function recursively but that caused a stack overflow after some time. (Can you
figure out how to write a long polling function in a non-recursive manner?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;codegl-or-a-failed-shenzhen-io-knockoff&quot;&gt;CodeGL, or a failed Shenzhen I/O knockoff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “game” that allows you to input assembler commands into an extremely
rudimentary text box.
These commands are fed into a virtual machine (built by Mark) and
run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a display showing the values of the 16 32-bit registers
so you can draw very rudimentary images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a display for RAM as well as extending the
parser/language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C++&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SDL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimal knowledge of how a CPU works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this incomplete project has not been touched for more than a month, I 
learned a lot from it. It was my first time writing C++ code and my first time doing anything
graphics library related (I used SDL). I was quite happy to actually be writing a
graphical application because I always had this impression that writing graphics
stuff was incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it would have been incredibly difficult had I not taken the CS50 course,
which introduced me to C. Otherwise I’m sorry to say that the unfamiliar syntax
would have scared me off (not to mention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-have-failed-at&quot;&gt;Things I have failed at&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-to-the-gym-consistently&quot;&gt;Going to the gym consistently&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made gains, but I could have made more had I been more disciplined and
less lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am still looking into a routine for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acca&quot;&gt;ACCA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a 500 dollar course with Marc and realised that 
a) accountancy is not for
me and 
b) my interest and comparative advantage lies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I have decided to abandon this track indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Marc (or rather Marc’s dad) told me that an ACCA qualification is useful
for going into finance into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swimming-15km&quot;&gt;Swimming 1.5km&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a couple of bad sunburns and falling sick I stopped swimming with
Wei Liang. I can swim freestyle much more comfortably than I could before I started
swimming this year but my stroke is still poor and there’s a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not like swimming in public pools because they are crowded and gross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I will pick this up in the future as a hobby and to get tan but I don’t
foresee swimming becoming a part of my life anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-to-drive&quot;&gt;Learning to drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did not learn to drive. I had better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will definitely have to learn sooner or
later… am thinking of learning it in May after my internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-are-neither-here-nor-there&quot;&gt;Things that are neither here nor there&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-50-books-in-a-year&quot;&gt;Reading 50 books in a year&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually succeeded in this endeavour (47 books–close enough) but I am 
parking this here as I do not feel
that this was a good use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong – I love books – but I didn’t feel like I really got anything
from them. Because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For skills like programming, reading books is not as useful
as doing and reading articles/code examples online. There are of course excellent
books like the Gang of Four’s 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns&quot;&gt;Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt; or JS: The Good Parts
but 
these books are meant more as
reference guides, so in what sense can you say to have “finished” them?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low retention. Looking at the book list I kept for this entire year,
I realise that I have forgotten most of the content of the books. I did not use 
to have this problem because I would reread books again and again until I had 
internalised completely the concepts of the books. But this year, in an effort to
hit the completely arbitrary number 50 (and also because I like buying new books),
I did not do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there anything that can be done to remedy this? I read that you are not 
 supposed to read non-fiction books the same way you read fiction books – that
 is, from cover to cover, page 1 to end. Instead you should selectively skim
 the book for information and actively summarise/take notes while reading. I
 did not do this and do not like doing this largely because it feels too much
 like &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; but I may have to give this method a try in the future. I did
 make some attempt at taking down notes but they were largely perfunctory and
 shit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teaching-at-ulu-pandan-stars&quot;&gt;Teaching at Ulu Pandan Stars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I did not very much enjoy the front part of teaching where I was
preparing them for the CodeXtreme hackathon. Many of the kids were simply not able
to learn any substantial programming concepts. I became much happier and far more
excited when I was able to pull out the four kids and try out my own curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that we have a clear goal for the kids – prepping them for DSA – is 
also extremely motivating. I am an extremely goal-oriented person and it helps me
greatly in my week-to-week planning if I have something in the future to look 
forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have filed this under “neither here nor there” because although the kids have 
already learned a lot, I have not delivered results yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;co-founding-codellective&quot;&gt;Co-founding Co{de}llective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will reserve judgement/comment on this as it’s too early to say anything about
it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;areas-for-improvement&quot;&gt;Areas for improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-management&quot;&gt;Time management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I did a lot of things this year but not very efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have improved greatly in that I do not slack off as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another subtle time-wasting bad habit I am guilty of and that is
my constant multitasking on the computer. It’s much more insidious because you 
think that you’re being productive and doing a lot of work but in reality you
haven’t established the Csikszentmihalyi-an “flow state” or “deep work” or
“intense focus” or whatever you want to call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had extremely occasional states whereby I was completely focused on the
task, be it reading a book or writing blog posts/code. 
Code is a little bit harder because it
necessitates a lot of SO and asking people for hep and that inherently breaks 
one’s rhythm. But there is no excuse for reading a book because I frequently got
distracted by small things like looking a word up on Pleco only to start replying
to Telegram messages, then going on Reddit… and even if the distraction lasts
only a few seconds, the flow state has been broken and productivity takes a 
nosedive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;completionist-streak&quot;&gt;Completionist streak&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to finish what you started and don’t be bantuerfei
but I have found that such one-dimensional thinking is not entirely
accurate either. Yes, I used to have (and still do have) the problem
of starting things or having goals and then not completing them. I 
identified this tendency early and made it my goal to drive this habit
out of my life by any means possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I realised after talking with Mark and reading some stuff online
like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pgbovine.net&quot;&gt;Prof Guo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://freakonomics.com/podcast/new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-the-upside-of-quitting/&quot;&gt;this Freakonomics podcast&lt;/a&gt;
that a single-minded focus on trying to complete something that’s honestly
not worth your time is actually counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was doing the course CS50 I complained to Mark that although the front few
lessons were very educational, the later webdev lessons were not as they covered
ground that I already know. Mark told me that there’s no need to finish the course,
just like there’s no need to finish reading books or textbooks. The most important
thing is to get the information and learn as much as you can from the resource; 
it isn’t important at all if you “finish” it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have had a change in thinking and am no longer adamant about finishing the
CS50 course. However, I will still do Problem Set 8 and the Final project because
I think those two problem sets are educational for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the challenge is in being able to identify which goals are not worth
pursuing or completing because I don’t learn from them, 
and which goals I don’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like completing because they
are boring, difficult or hard to measure progress toward. It’s still 
very important to be able to “finish strong” (Prof Guo’s words,
not mine), of course, and this grit is a quality that I have to continue to cultivate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy with the way 2016 went. I have been productive and I have achieved the
goals I care most about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also just as important is the fact that I have tried new things and quit them 
when I realised that I did not care about them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of this blog post sounding like an Oscar acceptance speech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am
extremely grateful to Mark, without whom all the aforementioned technical projects 
would be impossible to complete. He has gotten me unstuck more times than I can count
and possesses an incredible patience for putting up with my incessant questions.
Also, for hosting me at his house many times.
(The same goes for Wei Heng, minus the hosting me at his house part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to CKY for being my best friend and being the only person I can 
bounce my silly game design/writing/business ideas off of. I also admire him greatly for
being extremely prolific and driven in his field of game design and development
and I hope that some of that productivity will rub off on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ariel has helped me a lot as an enthusiastic and responsive sounding-board for
my ideas. More than anyone else I have shared with her my ideas and concerns
about the Co{de}llective and Python Titans projects and she has always given me
good advice and honest feedback. She also spent two weekends of her time to 
help me run the nerve-wracking pilot program at IDA (on extremely short notice,
no less). I cannot thank her enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have Ming Shi to thank for introducing me to Ulu Pandan Stars and Mrs Hauw and
I owe him a meal. And speaking of Mrs Hauw, I must also be grateful to her for
giving me so much free rein with the C4C P5 class and for giving me the opportunity
to intern at her company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Sean, for helping me do my WITS poster despite his NS commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thanked all these people for their contribution to my goals but I’d also
like to point out that I enjoy their company greatly and am grateful for that, too.
To that end, I’d like to thank all of my friends for being patient 
with my flaws, honest with their feedback, and liberal with their company.&lt;/p&gt;

I think before
I go about writing 2016’s Year in Review I should post this one, for completeness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 has come to an end and I think it’s a good idea to write down the big things that have transpired this year and what I can look forward to in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year was the transition from student to NSF and the transition has not been entirely pleasant. Although I’m quite pleased with my current vocation and job scope I have a slipped disc and a fucked-up wrist to show for my troubles. I did not have a good time in BMT but I have met some new acquaintances and we meet up occasionally. I’m on OK terms with my colleagues at work as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other large event was of course  my trip to Oxford and I think this was the highlight of the year in terms of personal growth. I think it gave me a real new perspective with regard to interpersonal relationships and it got me out of my rut as well. It wasn’t the trip per se that was really helpful as much as it was the months of reading books and writing notes. It made the wait in army more bearable, I learned a lot, and i think that I should continue with this attitude of learning in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I think I did quite well in 2015 were the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did well in creating a budget and meticulously documenting my spending, and am accurate to the dollar. I will be improving the spreadsheet in 2016 by tracking my spending by category (the abortive attempt to create the Pennywise budgeting app has been shelved indefinitely) and using some graphs as well which will be quite cool hehe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did well in reading a lot of books in preparation for Oxford and although I don’t have anything to prepare for anymore I have set a goal of reading 48 books this year - that’s four books a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do so well in the realm of interpersonal relationships. I guess part of this is inevitable because all my close friends are splitting up and going for NS and of course the girls are going to uni and all that. I don’t feel like I’m that close with my colleagues in the workplace either. And of course I’m still single but I’m honestly not that bothered despite all the noise I make about it because (i) my previous experience has made me realise that it’s hard to find a partner who shares a lot of my values and (ii) I should concentrate on self-improvement rather than chasing tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, 20 is a significant milestone. It should be a portent of greater maturity now that I’ve crossed over into adulthood. Every year I tell myself that I should play less computer games and it never happens… because my friends are very bad influences…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lieuzhenghong</name></author><category term="annual review" /><category term="progress report" /><category term="goal setting" /><summary type="html">I wrote this last year in a Google Doc before this blog existed.

this is a period of unprecedented freedom and it’s imperative i &lt;strong&gt;don’t waste my time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the month of November it was a huge rut for me– didn’t get any work done, any
project finished or finish reading any book and this is really unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is that I am &lt;strong&gt;waking up too late&lt;/strong&gt;. This really harshes my
vibe because I usually wake up at 10am/11am and it’s this no-man’s-land kind of
timing whereby I convince myself to makan first before going gym but by then
it’s so late and i drag drag drag… case in point, it’s &lt;del&gt;3pm&lt;/del&gt; 4pm now and I still
haven’t moved my fucking ass to the gym yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to correct my sleeping schedule so that I am sleeping at midnight and waking up 9am latest. This will allow me to make 10am gym which is just nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ive-to-do-in-december&quot;&gt;What I’ve to do in December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be travelling from 11th to 24th so somehow need to find opportunities to work out.
And to complete the rest of my projects as stated below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catch up to the original plan of 52 books (give myself discount la, 50 will do…)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Currently: 43 books which means&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;7 books in 4 weeks: that’s roughly two books a week which is
honestly doable&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;current book (Tuesday: a fanti 36ji book: to finish by this week,
  I have to finish 6 jis a day). then it’s 2 books a week henceforth&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish CS50!!! This is a MUST:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Problem Set 6 – can be done in a day&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Problem Set 7 – ditto&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Problem Set 8 – a little bit more involved&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Final project: currently working on the opengl CPU as a just-for-fun final project.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the Co{de}llective site up and running
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kay has already almost finished with the design so it’s up to me now to translate it into reality&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut to 67kg bodyweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plans-for-january&quot;&gt;Plans for January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From 4th–14th Jan I will be overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then I start my internship on the 23rd and that will last for 3–4 months.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And I can’t forget to get my stuff ready to apply for scholarships/internships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve about a week before my internship starts: I’m going to use that time to
build a nice front-end interface for my budgeting spreadsheet. The 2016 version
is honestly pretty shitty and messy and sometimes (I don’t know why) doesn’t work at all. I’m probably not going to build a full on app but perhaps just
a glorified form on mobile (maybe even using Google Forms but I kind of want to try out Vue), I think that would work great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I also built a bash script (Mark’s idea) to make the process of 
updating this blog easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Generates the _site folder and moves its contents to the lieuzhenghong.github.io folder &lt;/span&gt;

bundle &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;jekyll build
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DESTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;../lieuzhenghong.github.io/
rm -rf ../lieuzhenghong.github.io/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
mv -v ./_site/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$DESTDIR&lt;/span&gt; 
rm -rf ./_site/
rm -f &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$DESTDIR&lt;/span&gt;/build.she&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content><author><name>lieuzhenghong</name></author><category term="monthly review" /><category term="progress report" /><summary type="html">these two chrysalid years are finally over:

&lt;p&gt;October was the month of MOOCs. I read a grand total of zero books but I started
on CS50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October was also the month of lapses: I started playing computer games again, spending ~10 hours on Dota 2, ~5 hours on Borderlands 2, and ~10 hours on CrusaderQuest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;strong&gt;three whole days of work&lt;/strong&gt; assuming 8-hour days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I’m particularly ashamed of is the fact that I squandered the last week (24–28) after keeping up an admirable momentum for the first two–three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I estimate that I’ve wasted around 8 days in total of a 28-day month and this is
of course unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to start planning my time better. In particular, after I ORD I will have
the freedom to structure my time to a far greater extent. No hour should be
wasted—this is the minimum modicum of discipline that I should expect from
myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I realised that I’ve hit the 85kg 5x5 stated in my “current
projects” page. I also managed to bench 105kg ORM—I will update the current projects page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projects-for-november&quot;&gt;Projects for November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my current projects for the month of November:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smart home project
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The issue I’m currently facing now is a problem with serial output coming
 from Arduino. Instead of receiving data every line, sometimes I receive the
 data as follows: “line1 \n line2” as one data object.
 Mark suggested I write a buffer to print out the data line by line but…I’m
 not sure how to do it and have been putting it off.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Co{de}llective website
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This has to be up by 12th November: non-negotiable.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I’ve to get the site up and write some articles… shag af&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I realise that I’m less and less interested in webdev, at least building
 static websites… I learn nothing from it and it’s just really dull.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CS50: finish it up
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I started CS50 1st October and managed to do 5 problem sets in one month. I
 hope to be able to finish up CS50x by November and then start MIT’s
 Analytics Edge in December.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scholarships: look for and apply for them
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I have blocked off the months of Dec and Jan for travel. (December with
family; January with class) Hence, there won’t     be time for me to do
anything serious then.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;My scholarship deadlines are March—that means I have only one month + to
prepare and submit my scholarships.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;That’s why it’s important to start looking now (after November 12).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;currently-worrying-about&quot;&gt;Currently worrying about&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ORD
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I realise that I’m not looking forward to ORD as much as I should. I really
 wanted to ORD but now that it’s right around the horizon the sense of
 freedom has been relpaced with some sort of dread and I’m not (as) keen to
 ORD. The dread is the recognition that I will have an enormous block of free
 time and I will have the responsiblity of using it properly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There are also things that I previously took for granted in the army but
 can’t anymore: for example, I’ve to find a new gym and pay for it (TGN is 8
 dollars an entry; membership at 75 dollars a month)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scholarship
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Critical if I’m to go to Oxford—enough said&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Major choice
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Change major or no? Tech is becoming more and more relevant and I’m not sure
 about the relevance of a PPE degree.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

Then I
went to teach the C4C P5 class (Dylan, Gao Hong, Audrey and Gillian).  Last
week, I taught them lessons 1 and 2 (the input and print command) and this week
I taught Python Turtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have reproduced my message to the C4C P5 group here, as it nicely sums up how
the lesson went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/audrey_gillian_yi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image posted by zhengyang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;just to add a bit of context to Zheng Yang’s post, and a post-mortem of today’s
lesson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have been teaching them Python for two weeks now according to my curriculum.
Last week they learned four main things: 
  - the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function, 
  - the concept of variables, 
  - taking user input with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; and
  - type conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We spent the first ~45 minutes of the day on recapping those four things.
Then we moved on to the next lesson, which is drawing with Python’s turtle
module.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The kids were all able to grasp the concept of the turtle very quickly— this
bolsters my confidence in Turtle as a teaching tool.  And the photo by Zheng
Yang is the Chinese character 易 done by Audrey and Gillian. I think it is
very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Overall, all the lesson objectives were met and I was pleased with the
progress of the lesson. Audrey, Gillian and Dylan were focused and
well-behaved, Gao Hong not so much (but still relatively tractable). I would
like especially to commend Dylan, who went to the library to borrow a book
about Python programming on his own accord! Very pleased with his interest and
I feel that given his young age, he will be an accomplished coder very soon as
long as we continue to stoke his interest and challenge him. Maybe it’s not
too early to think about &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; DSA…. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One last thing —thanks to Zhen Yang and Poe for coming today. 
I hope to see all you guys again next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Mrs Hauw after the lesson. She had approached me earlier this week to
offer me an internship at Iglobe once I finish NS. She said on Telegram that the
internship would take about 6-8 months and I expressed this concern to her.
Whereupon she said “Since when I said 6-8 months? I told you Yau Xuan interned
for 6 months, you only need to do 4 months”…which was weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some other concerns but she waved them aside… I told her that I had to
apply for scholarships whereupon she said “Aiya your scholarship need to apply
full time meh?” or something along those lines. She mentioned that she had
already received applications from undergraduates. I asked her how I would
represent skills that are non-credentialed (i.e. basically all programming
skills) and she said that it will show in the interview. I then asked “Then do I
have to do the interview?” and she smiled and said “I already interviewed you
already what.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave me some more tips about writing the CV and told me that “there’s no
such thing as modesty” when I said that I was reluctant to put non-credentialed
skills on my CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have read her correctly (and I could be wrong…) she is basically saying
that the CV is a mere formality and she already wants me for the job. 
But either way I
have to write a CV and make it a good one since this CV isn’t just for this
internship application, it’s for all subsequent applications so best to bite the
bullet and do it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have a strong focus right now–tech, and teaching tech. I am
fortunate to have free rein over what I can teach the kids. That gives
me an advantage over others who may not be as focused in their CIP. But more on
strategic CV writing in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After C4C and the meeting with Mrs Hauw I went to the gym with Chew (Delta Gym)
and both Chew and I failed all our lifts. It wasn’t even a good fail it was a
totally embarassing fail… like 2 reps and can’t push any more kind of fail.
Meh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-joosy-part&quot;&gt;The joosy part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is when the really joosy part comes in. So after gym we called up Nauxiy
and asked him to join us for dinner. We agreed to meet at Star Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Buona MRT, while we were taking the escalator down, Chew pointed out to me 
an old Indian man who looked like he was stuck on the escalator. From what we
could see, because he kept moving backward, it looked like his leg was stuck in
the escalator! I quickly ran down only to see the guy walking backwards,
barefoot, like it was the most normal thing in the world. He was facing the
“right” way (that is, the normal way) but walking backwards. I must confess that
I was completely taken aback as I had &lt;strong&gt;no fucking idea&lt;/strong&gt; what he was doing and
I just stood there not knowing what to do…
until some guy came behind me and pulled the man off the escalator. One
uncle asked him “Are you drunk?” and he mumbled, grinning, yes I am very drunk.
Thank you very much. 
The
uncle asked him to take the stairs and I watched him climb up the stairs
barefoot (his slippers were upstairs with another Indian man, his friend
probably).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now I still don’t know what he was trying to do…lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had actually thought of pulling the Indian man off the escalator but I was
afraid that he would stumble and fall and really get something caught in the
escalator. I think this shows that my decision-making capability needs work
though I had no idea that he was drunk as I haven’t met many inebriated people
before. Maybe if I had known I would have acted faster. As it was I just stood
there like a fucking idiot lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-even-joosier-part&quot;&gt;The even joosier part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the even joosier part. We went to EighteenChefs (the Western food
place run by an ex-convict that specially hires ex-convicts to give them a
second chance). The food there was quite affordable. There was this NSF promotion
where baked cheese rice is only like 7.50 and it tasted pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this large group of students (I think eight or ten people) who were
seated opposite us. I had my eye on a thick one (hehehe).
We were discussing whether they were poly or uni students but anyway they
finished and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waiter, this short guy with big round glasses and a full sleeve on his left 
arm, went
to separate the tables and clean up. I saw him take a phone from the chair and
grin as he walked away. I made a throwaway remark “lol the waiter just took
someone’s phone”. I didn’t think anything of it as I assumed that he was just
taking it for safekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After like ten or fifteen minutes Thick and Thin came in looking very anxious.
They asked the waiter whether he had seen Thick’s phone and the waiter put on a
very concerned face and said no, whereupon he started putting up a big show
looking for the phone under the table and asking them to call the phone. His
&lt;em&gt;wayang&lt;/em&gt; was so good they should have given him golden horse! In fact it was so
good that I was gaslighted. Although I had definitely seen him take the phone I
became not so sure. But nonetheless I walked up to them after the waiter had
left to presumably look for the phone and asked them “You guys are looking for
your phone right?” and told them “I’m pretty sure I saw one of the staff take
your phone” whereupon they asked me, quite naturally, who was the staff member.
Again although I was quite sure it was that guy, I was i) gaslighted and ii) did
not want to accuse someone wrongly so I said that I wasn’t sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then because I was so gaslighted I actually went back to my table and asked the
gang whether I had actually seen the phone being taken? And &lt;em&gt;thank god&lt;/em&gt; I had
made that throwaway remark earlier because they confirmed that I had did indeed
said that and something as specific as “the waiter took a phone” is quite
reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five to ten minutes of what must be unadulterated panic felt by the girls,
they managed to get a hold of the manager who told them that he would go and
check the CCTV. After he went in he came out, returned the phone, and told them 
that the phone was
found &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; but to give them their phone number as he wanted to conduct an
“investigation”. I wasn’t smart enough to read the subtext but someone told me
that the manager said “outside” to safeguard the reputation of the restaurant
and in actual fact (of course) it was found in the grubby pockets of that fuckin
thief. Thus vindicated by this fact, I felt secure enough to tell Thick and Thin
that I was pretty sure that it was that waiter who took the phone. (And
apparently Nauxiy said that the waiter gave our table a really dirty look). The
girls thanked me and left. Nauxiy finished his waffle and we left.
江山易改，本性难移!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-could-i-have-done-better&quot;&gt;What could I have done better?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in two minds about this incident. On the one hand, I think that I handled it
&lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; compared to the drunken Indian man incident. But maybe I could have
handled it better? I played it too conservative and Bayesian and kept saying
that I wasn’t sure who the waiter was. But maybe I should have just walked up to
the waiter and told him something alpha like “brother, I saw you take the phone,
give it to us there’s no need to call police”. (And also I could have walked with 
them more all the way to help them solve the incident instead of returning to my table). 
After all, it was a public place,
I was bigger than him and wearing a singlet. But of course these are things that
are really &lt;em&gt;l’esprit de l’escalier&lt;/em&gt;… you fantasise about how you would have
done it in the &lt;strong&gt;cool&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ALPHA&lt;/strong&gt; way but in the real world when it happens
you’re bo ji and do it the humji way, very 婉转!! And this 婉转 way definitely caused the girls some unnecessary anguish. So I have to train myself to be a more alpha
man and don’t be afraid of confrontation like a pussy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that is the takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing (and this one I think it’s a real pity) is that I didn’t get
Thick’s number 😂😂. We were joking about it on the train like “since the
manager asked for her number you should’ve asked for her number too” but more 
and more I’m thinking that &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; I should have done that… hahaha. After all
you did a good deed so that’s social proof that you’re a Good Person so why not
capitalise on the fact that you did her a huge favour and she has a good
impression of you to get to know her better right??? Of course (as nauxiy
rightly pointed out) that diminishes the goodness of the Good Deed but fuck it,
I don’t live to do good deeds but we literally live to get our dicks wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also like neither of them thought Thick was chio so &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt; i was
mocked for my low standards and unorthodox taste. But there was a very cute girl
wearing a white dress and a choker (apparently that’s very hot to the two of
them) and we all agreed that she was chio.&lt;/p&gt;

The first commit was 3 days ago (18th
September) but I first started working on it on 27th August. Then I took a three-week
break and resumed working on it on 17th September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the bot out on Telegram &lt;a href=&quot;https://telegram.me/charge_game_bot&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;
The Github repo is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lieuzhenghong/charge-bot/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This checked a couple of technical firsts for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First Telegram bot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time I used Python to write anything substantial&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First deploy on Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time using non-ASCII characters and working with UTF-8 encoding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time using a linter (pylint)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a couple of non-technical firsts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time building a multiplayer “game”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time building anything my friends can use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First time building something for public consumption (apart from a blog)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also the first time I wrote anything for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am quite happy with this project. The scope was manageable and it did
not balloon (probably because it was a game and, being a game, the scope is rather
clearly defined; what also helped was the limitations of the Telegram medium). 
At the same time, I was able to incorporate user feedback and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python code to write a Telegram bot is extremely trivial.
It is just a while loop that sends HTTP requests with a long timeout (long
polling). Upon receiving a response, it sends the next request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way which is push instead of pull (doesn’t send requests: waits for
Telegram to send updates to you) but it is far more involved and wasn’t suitable for a
first-time project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'getUpdates?offset={0}&amp;amp;timeout={1}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;handle_updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. But there was a gotcha: As my background is in Javascript where all responses
are asynchronous, the line &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;req = requests.get(string)&lt;/code&gt; tripped me up. If you were to write
that in Javascript you would get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;req == undefined&lt;/code&gt; or something like that and thus
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;handle_updates(req)&lt;/code&gt; would throw an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Python, the synchronous nature of the code means that the assignment operator will
actually stop the evaluation until it returns a proper result. That means no callback is
needed and the code becomes very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snafus&quot;&gt;Snafus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modularisation&quot;&gt;Modularisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was something that I had a lot of trouble with, despite Mark’s best efforts to help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My code is divvied up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* index.py (should be main.py): is the main file, imports everything
* network.py: sends requests and handles responses
* lobby.py: code that allows players to create and join a game
* game.py: game code
* charge_keyboard.py: the inline keyboard needed for the game
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unable to understand the idea of a function that called another function (also known
as… a callback function LOL). Here’s what I had trouble with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# network.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setPushDataTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pushDataToDispatcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# index.py&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;Initialises the app and sets up all callbacks&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setPushDataTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dispatcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dispatcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this pattern allows a function in one file to call a function in another file,
&lt;em&gt;without importing&lt;/em&gt;. The reason why we cannot import is because we don’t want a two-way
import (index imports network, not the other way round).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we still need some way for the “child” to communicate with the “parent” and the way
to do it is by setting the callback function in the “child” to the parent’s function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure I am explaining it clearly…I’ll come back in a few days to this post
and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploying-on-heroku&quot;&gt;Deploying on Heroku&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku was a real pain to set up…the documentation was lacking and I spent two nights’
worth just trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of it is that you have to have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; and a
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;runtime.txt&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Getting Started with Heroku” tutorial mentioned the first two but not the last one!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; is just a list of dependencies… that’s quite straightforward
I still don’t know what &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;runtime.txt&lt;/code&gt; does but I had to put in the line &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python-3.5.2&lt;/code&gt; in
order for Heroku to deploy my app with Python 3. I needed Python 3 because of it’s native
Unicode handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by that is: when Python2 receives a response as a string, it doesn’t actually
use Unicode encoding. In order to get it as Unicode you have to put a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;u'&lt;/code&gt; in front of it.
Python 3 does this all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Procfile is also not straightforward. Basically the Procfile tells Heroku what kind of
dyno your app is (web, worker, something else), what file to run with what program. So
like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;worker: python index.py --loglevel=info&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Weirdly, typing python3 index.py throws some weird error and I don’t know why and haven’t
been able to Google)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-code&quot;&gt;Bad code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app was developed very haphazardly, and it shows. I used tons of global variables
because I’m very bad. Coming from a Javascript background I don’t know how to use classes,
like, &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. So it’s good that I’m learning Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried refactoring but it was truly a huge pain and I actually had to rollback to the
previous commit because I fucked everything up. 😭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-points-and-future-plans&quot;&gt;Learning points and future plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make as many bots as I can in the future, because Telegram is by far the most-used
app on my phone. It was extremely smart of the Telegram team to expose this API to developers–
this has allowed it to eclipse Whatsapp even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my next app, I will definitely try and use the webhooks push method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku has a free dyno tier so I have &lt;strong&gt;no idea&lt;/strong&gt; why I’m paying 8 dollars a month to DigitalOcean.
I think that I will move my automated transaction tracker over to Heroku as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the bad code: for my next app I am going to try and write it &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt; and I
know everyone says that but I mean it, I’m going to aim for 0 warnings on pylint!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a good learning experience, I had fun. Am pretty psyched to build my

SMTI Comd. They said that the idea is a very good one but they were concerned
about sustainability: what will happen when I’m gone? I told them that they
could always hire me back as a consultant and that joke was rather
well-received. They were quite excited and every one of them came up with
possibilities for their branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I didn’t win Gold, I only won silver which means I don’t get to
present, but I have to do a poster. Also we won $320… how much of that $320 is
mine will have to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This WITS project was supposed to be my ticket to recognition. I’m not sure what
chance I have now with “only” a silver. I am meeting Maj Susan on Wednesday and
I will see what she says… hopefully there’s still a chance of progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iDA group has now only Rahman and me. Gabriel is trying to hang on but he
has commitment issues. Putting that aside, I’m not sure where this group is
going. Will I have to be labouring for months, years, with nothing to show for
it? We need big wins–we need to be doing something different. The idea Rahman
had is to be a &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; that ties everyone together. That of course raises
the questions: what kind of community? and what will this community do? and I
have not been able to get a satisfactory answer from them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My teaching the kids at Ulu Pandan is still continuing week by week but what am
I doing? The idea was to start my own Python thing but I’ve been teaching them
for so long and in any case, this is just me being subsumed into something that
others have started…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of my projects seem to have come to a halt. I have to come up with new
ideas, new initiatives that I can push. But these three projects are sapping my
time and energy and giving me nothing in return. It is like an enormous ball and
chain is tied to me and I cannot run with all of this accumulated deadweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some more things that I have to worry about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether to take BMAT;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have to study for ACCA F1-F3;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn driving when?&lt;/li&gt;

We managed to go ahead
with the iDA pilot class (not entirely up to my expectations). The kids’
hackathon is now over. I am now one year older and have entered &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; the
twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time seems to pass extremely quickly and I feel like I should be doing
more–much more–if I am to secure a scholarship. I can’t help but feel
frustrated that the things I have to do are gated by other people. I can work at
a blistering pace but if I’ve to wait for others to get back to me this limits
what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I’ve also been doing things that I feel are not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;
useful with respect to getting a scholarship and part of me wonders if I should 
even bother. There are things that I have chosen to put on hold (driving) 
but there is the matter of ACCA and I’m not
sure how much effort to devote to that. It would be excellent if I can finish
F1-F3 by the end of this year but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course hobbies such as ping-pong or 书法 and so on which I want to get
better at but am I getting anything out of it and is it sapping my time? At the 
risk of sounding like a broken record, anything that doesn’t bring me closer to
getting the scholarship I want is (by definition) unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that not all the things I embark upon will bear fruit. (I briefly
harboured the hope that my WITS project could give me something but I am now 
convinced that the entire endeavour is otiose). But what else can I do apart
from cast the net wide and hope that something sticks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t a rhetorical question. I still maintain that the best way to get a
scholarship is to do one thing and do it extremely well. But what is this thing?
I am perfectly willing to devote my time and energy to
a cause as long as this cause will pop up and say, please devote your
time and energy to me and you will not be stonewalled by other people, and it
will be able to grow, and it will all be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This futility has given me somewhat of a 野心 in the sense that I am now
unsure of what course to take. There is no doubt in my mind that Oxford is my
first choice but as the hope of getting a scholarship dwindles, I am now
considering second/third choices. I have told a friend that I intend to take the
BMAT with him and I am considering going into medicine because apparently law is
on the down and down. I am even considering going back into engineering (REP
seems quite attractive)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may leave modesty by the side for a while I believe I deserve a
scholarship. I think I have the drive to self-criticise and self-improve.
Largely this is borne by the deep-seated insecurity that I am simply not good
enough. I also have another advantage that others don’t: I don’t value my
personal time because I know that I am nowhere near disciplined enough to make
good use of it. Therefore, I am able to put in a lot of effort into doing
whatever the hell the organisation wants me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now the 11th of August and I had best start planning my after-work
timetable. Very soon I will have armoury duty to do and will (probably) not have
this luxury. For now, however, I must make full use of my time at home and not
waste it playing Hearthstone or watching Youtube videos or chatting to friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perennial feeling of not doing enough with my life has emerged yet again
and all I can do is try to salve it.&lt;/p&gt;

The obvious questions are “Why did this
happen?” and What happens now?” I &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; write about the consequences 
because there are many articles right now revelling in this sort of
speculation. I want to talk about the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken by surprise by the result, and from the unprecedented fall of the
pound it is obvious that the financial markets were not expecting this outcome
as well. If one were to browse the international news right before the
referandum one would have walked away with a view completely different from
reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a campaign of misrepresentation, appeals to emotion and outright
falsehoods the Leave camp has manipulated the voting populace extremely
effectively. I’d like to talk about this “unreasonable effectiveness” and
discuss how voices of reason can reassert themselves in the realm of public
discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i&quot;&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave rallied behind the battering-ram of immigration. A coherent and consistent 
narrative was spun: joining the EU had allowed in migrants, who had come to steal jobs,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://infacts.org/mail-online-corrects-inaccurate-
nhs-migrant-story/&quot;&gt;siphon NHS funds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/
news/article-3558818/ISIS-cells-UK-Germany-Italy-says-James-Clapper-Director-

news/uk/644855/EU-migrants-crime-Britain-deportation-migrant-crisis-free-movement-rules&quot;&gt;commit crimes with impunity&lt;/a&gt;,
and so on. Many of these articles were later ruled “significantly misleading” by the 
Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO); but how many read a fifty-four
word retraction tucked in a corner somewhere, and how many read the
headline of the front page?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This curation of Daily Express headlines shows very clearly the anti-immigrant
stance of the tabloids. Some gems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“You Pay For Roma Gypsy Palaces”,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Migrants Cost Britain 17Bn A Year” (migrants contribute more in taxes than they
draw in benefits)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My personal favourite: “&lt;strong&gt;The Invaders&lt;/strong&gt;” (starring Will
Smith).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii&quot;&gt;II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who took him seriously when Trump announced his presidency in 2015? The man
almost seems like a comedian. “Ban all Muslims”, 
“Build a wall”, &lt;a href=&quot;https:
//twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en&quot;&gt;global warming is a Chinese conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;. 
He holds the honour of being Politifact’s &lt;a href=&quot;http:
//www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/&quot;&gt;biggest liar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/trump_on_fire.png&quot; alt=&quot;Some of Trump's claims&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A random selection of
Trump’s latest soundbites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely such a charlatan will not be entertained? Apparently not–he has the
Republican nomination. It remains to be seen if he will be elected President,
but it is clear that telling blatant lies can only help one’s chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii&quot;&gt;III&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s extremely successful campaign and the Leave vote demonstrate two
phenomena:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “derision of the farcical”. 
We laugh at what Trump says because it’s so blatantly false it’s ridiculous,
but it’s not so obvious to the Trump supporter. 
Derision is no substitute for action; 
if we fail to correct these falsehoods we are digging our own graves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “unreasonable effectiveness of demagoguery”.
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the claims of Trump and the 
Leave camp have been allowed to stand, and people have been especially receptive
to their narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-derision-of-the-farcical&quot;&gt;The derision of the farcical&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the GOP, Remain had underestimated the threat that was brewing because for
a long time, it seemed like populist drivel. The thought of people actually
voting for Leave was simply too ridiculous to be true. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn
felt secure enough to make this misstep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Jeremy Corbyn was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-
referendum-36506163&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; how he rated his enthusiasm for staying in the EU out of
10, he said 7 to 7.5…[But he] needed to send a ‘clear message’ that we needed
to stay in the EU. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mainlymacro.blogspot.sg/
2016/06/defending-george-osborne-on-brexit-once.html#links&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbyn’s answer was an honest one, but completely inadequate in a war of ideologies.
Such a statement was (predictably) pounced upon as a sign of weakness–even Corbyn isn’t
sure if he wants to stay in the EU!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Remain camp finally realised the need to “play ball” and they did what they could, 
but &lt;a href=&quot;https:
//economistsforremain.org/&quot;&gt;Economists for Remain&lt;/a&gt; was too little too late. How can a website, however
flawless its academic credentials, compete with the months–if not years–of
anti-migrant sentiment fomented by the tabloids?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://
62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/
126909/area14mp/image-20160616-15079-mi76nm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Remain versus Leave newspapers, weighted by circulation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighted by circulation, the UK press was extremely one-sided on the issue of
Brexit. The man on the street was far more likely to walk away with the
impression that migrants from EU enact an enormous economic toll. But do
Jeremy Corbyn or David Cameron make the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; a part of their daily
reading? Even if they had, would they have dismissed it out of hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a catastrophic failure to read the ground and Remain could have
struck back earlier, but did not do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-demagoguery&quot;&gt;The unreasonable effectiveness of demagoguery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bastiat’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window&quot;&gt;parable of the broken window from &lt;em&gt;Ce qu’on voit et ce qu’on
ne voit pas&lt;/em&gt; (1850)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James Goodfellow, when his careless son has happened to break a pane of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation – “It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier’s trade – that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs – I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, “Stop there! Your theory is confined to that which is seen; &lt;strong&gt;it takes no account of that which is not seen.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes a long way in explaining the “unreasonable
effectiveness of demagoguery”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see the migrant who takes your job. It’s easy to
see the migrant who commits a crime (it’s hard &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to see when it’s
plastered on the front page the next day). What is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder to see is
the lesser waiting times in the NHS, the faster recovery from the recession, the
lower tax burden on you and your children, lower prices overall…Remain had to
fight an uphill battle because of the dichotomy between &lt;strong&gt;what is seen v. what is
not.&lt;/strong&gt; Remain has lost the battle for public mindshare: the evidence
is firmly on their side, but it’s invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And of course, the same is true for Trump’s campaign: 
it’s easy to see the media blitz over 
radical Islamic terrorists, the Boston bombing or the Orlando shooting, but 
not so easy to see the Muslims who contribute silently and productively to the
economy. But an article about a normal American Muslim who does normal
American things is not going to move many copies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;v&quot;&gt;V&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-backlash-against-political-correctness&quot;&gt;The backlash against political correctness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the US and UK there exist left- and right-wing media. I’ve just talked about
right-wing media; the conservative, sensationalist, rabidly anti-immigrant tabloids. 
It’s tempting
to think of liberal media as the bearers of truth (perhaps because everyone who
will read this lies firmly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/
2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/&quot;&gt;that tribe&lt;/a&gt;), 
but of course liberal media isn’t entirely innocent, and may have dug its own
grave in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend in liberal media today is a greater sensitivity towards minority or
marginalised groups. But too often this political correctness has been
used to silence discourse on issues that matter to the electorate. 
There is a feeling amongst the
ground that politicians have been skirting issues for fear of being bashed by
the liberal media.
The fiasco where &lt;a href=&quot;http:
//www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-bigoted-woman&quot;&gt;Gordon Brown called a woman ‘bigoted’&lt;/a&gt; lost him
the election and exemplifies the divide between the working-class and left-leaning politicians. Brown gaffed, of course–merely being concerned about immigration does not
make one a bigot–but perhaps it was a knee-jerk reaction cultivated by the
need never to appear racist at all costs. Or perhaps Brown had already bought
into the narrative that &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;discussing
immigration’s costs is bigotry&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s campaign so resonates with voters because of the backlash against
PC. Rightly or wrongly, the people have seen the Democrats as unwilling to
engage on the issues that matter to them (whether they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter or not
is besides the point): radical Islamic terrorism and
immigration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, both left- and right-wing media have both contributed to
anti-immigrant sentiment: the left has overcorrected, 
creating a culture of shame that suppresses legitimate political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;VI&lt;/h2&gt;
