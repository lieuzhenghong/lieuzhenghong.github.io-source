<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Although this is entitled “2018 in review”, it ends in June 2018. There are two
reasons for this. First, dividing up the year by the academic term is a much
more natural way to do it; I’ve just wrapped up my first year in Oxford and my
thoughts are much fresher than they would be if I waited until December to
write this post.  Besides, in December I’ll probably be writing my blog post
about Michaelmas 2018.</p>

<p>Secondly, I realised that I didn’t write a 2017 year-in-review post so I’ll use
this post to do that. Truth be told my memory of 2017 at this point is rather
hazy; I’ll have to look at my old posts to bootstrap my memory.</p>

<p>The older I get, the more grateful I am for having started this blog in 2016.
Otherwise I don’t remember the things I have done, but more importantly, I
forget many of the thoughts I had! The latter is critical to me because it’s
incredibly illuminating to look back on my past and see the anxieties I
suffered from. Do I still hold the fears I used to, or no longer, and why if
so—have I overcome them, or were they just idle worries? If the latter, can I
update my worry-heuristic so that I can better distinguish between “I need to
fix this NOW” and “this too shall pass”?</p>

<h1 id="thoughts-about-this-year-and-a-half">Thoughts about this year-and-a-half?</h1>

<p>I have had a great year and a half. Some of it is helped by the fact that
I have moved to a different stage of life, which has been incredibly exciting
and liberating. In <a href="/2017/09/24/life-report-sep-2017.html">September 2017</a>
I wrote that “this post marks the end of an era… the chrysalid years are
over, and I fly to Heathrow to begin my new life as a student tomorrow night”.
And that’s exactly right. The start of 2017 marked my transition from soldier
to layabout, and 2018 the transition from layabout to student and young adult.
The challenges I face now are far more interesting and I feel like I have more
agency to tackle them.</p>

<h2 id="academic">Academic</h2>

<p>I decided to go to Oxford instead of NTU, and (while it’s difficult to know the
counterfactual) I think I made the right decision. I am flourishing. I’m
enjoying myself greatly. The rigour of writing essays twice a week clarifies my
thinking and stretches myself academically. Living out is a source of great joy
as I enjoy cooking for myself and my friends. I greatly cherish the privacy and
self-actualisation granted by my own independence. Being in a highly proximate
environment with like-minded friends means that I always feel enriched by their
close company and conversation.</p>

<p>I had doubts about PPE lacking rigour at the start but I now believe that if I
take the right quantitative modules and keep up my technology self-study, I
will be able to compete favourably with CS graduates. If nothing else, I have a
comparative advantage in the specific intersection of finance/econ and
coding—although I have heard that they still do prefer physics/maths/CS
grads. It will be up to me to pivot myself career-wise.</p>

<p>But as a degree I greatly enjoy the work I do in PPE—it is a truly
multidisciplinary degree, particularly in the first year.  I enjoyed writing
essays more than I expected.  There’s something about writing essays that
forces you to know your stuff and construct a clear argument in your head—You
don’t know you don’t know something until you’re forced to write an essay about
it. I’ve gotten better at this over time (as I should; setting aside Economics
essays, I wrote a total of 21 essays in 16 weeks and one more substantial
Q-STEP essay), and I look forward to increasing the speed with which I can
formulate a clear, succinct, and powerful argument.</p>

<p>I still lack clarity. I can put forward most relatively straightforward
arguments with aplomb, but struggle with conveying certain more nuanced
arguments (that have multiple conditional premises/branching forks). For
example, A can either be B or C. If B, then D, which is not what we want, and
if C, then E, which contradicts A. Hence, ~A. I wrote two Theopol essays with
this structure (Rousseau and Marx) and they didn’t go well.</p>

<p>I have done relatively well this year, earning Fowler prizes every term. I was
well enough prepared for Prelims, particularly for Economics and Logic. I
didn’t do much revision for Theory of Politics but not much is needed to write
Theopol essays anyway. Unfortunately I made a wrong question selection for
Microeconomics my best paper and the Distinction is now in jeopardy.
Nonetheless, this is not a problem of insufficient preparation—it’s a problem
of bad exam strategy which I’ll have to remedy in the future. The key is
<em>reducing variance</em>: choosing questions I am sure I can do reasonably well
rather than questions that I’m not sure I can do but could do very well on. I
made the same mistake on Logic with choosing the Natural Deduction question
(which was a huge departure from the norm), but luckily I managed to do it
well.</p>

<h3 id="q-step-essay">Q-Step essay</h3>

<p>I am extremely pleased to have won the Q-STEP First Year Political Essay prize
for my essay <em>“Does Consensus Democracy Improve Economic Outcomes?</em> which I
wrote during Hilary Term. This prize is awarded to the best essay (out of ~300)
which all HPol and PPE students had to write in our Quantitative Political
Analysis course, and it comes with 200 quid as well! It feels great to beat all
the other smart Oxford fuckers and come top of the year for <em>something</em>.</p>

<p><a href="">insert image here</a></p>

<p>I can’t be too self-congratulatory, of course. It was more that I picked the
right battle. As this is a quantitative assignment, I knew that many PPE and
HPol students would not have the aptitude or interest to go above and beyond.
Further, I spent a lot of time during Hilary Term working on this essay, when
most people would have chosen to enjoy their term or revise for collections (in
truth, probably a better use of one’s time). It’s vanishingly unlikely that
I’ll be able to come top of the cohort in any other subsequent assignment or
paper, so I’ll take what I can get… haha.</p>

<p>You can read the essay <a href="http://github.com/lieuzhenghong/qstep-essay">here</a>. My
“excellent and novel contribution” was simply to extend Lijphart’s analysis in
two ways: i) using panel data and ii) bringing in more democracies. I showed
that doing so causes Lijphart’s purported relationship between consensus
democracy and social inequality (operationalised by the percentage of women in
parliament) to disappear.</p>

<p>I must thank Jarel for speaking with me about my essay and providing me with my
key theoretical insight, which came serendipitously two days before the essay
deadline! I had ran the regressions earlier and were very frustrated that I
couldn’t replicate Lijphart’s results. But Jarel said that in and of itself is
a very significant finding!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jarel: let me get this right: when you control for fixed effects, effects on gender
become insignificant — right?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: yes</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jarel: ok that’s a very strong result</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jarel: i think i might have to rewrite the analysis bit as well</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: im very excited now actually because of what you pointed out</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: haha</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and there we go: the absence of result is indeed an interesting result. So I
quickly added this final keystone and submitted it the next day. I don’t think
my essay would have been nearly as strong without this spin on the essay.</p>

<p>Reading the essay with a fresh eye (and with the help of the marker’s
comments), there are a couple of things I could have done better, which would
have pushed the essay from a 79 (High First; great work) to a 80 (Excellent
First; pretty much impossible to achieve). First of all, the
introduction/theoretical argument/methodological criticisms were written before
I had the key insight; I edited them hastily after-the-fact which necessarily
makes them a little disjointed and the key insight feel a bit tacked-on. I
should have put front-and-center the criticism that Lijphart selects on the
dependent variable by using FH to operationalise democracy. From the marker’s
report,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Argument: Your theoretical section mediates between Tsebelis and Lijphart,
whereas it would have been more convincing to derive unique theoretical
argument capturing your own intuitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There we go.</p>

<p>I must thank Sergi and Tak Huen for taking the time to look at my essay; in
particular my mentor Sergi, who was swamped running revision classes for the
PPE finalists. But most importantly Jeffrey, who was my QSTEP mentor and
actually Skyped me in Utah during the vac, and really went above and beyond.</p>

<p>What I’ve learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick your battles</li>
  <li>Sometimes serendipity plays a big part</li>
  <li>I worked extra hard and was rewarded for it</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="extracurricular">Extracurricular</h2>

<p>This is an area in which`I feel there is much room for improvement. By
“extracurricular” I refer to my CS self-study (MOOCs, algorithms practice) and
hobbies (cooking, lifting).</p>

<h3 id="cs-self-study">CS self-study</h3>

<p>I was able to get some CS self-study done this Christmas (finished N2T II) but
no work done in Hilary as I was focused on my QSTEP, which had very rudimentary
R. I think I made the right choice focusing on QSTEP but I think that I could
have done more; one problem on Leetcode per day would have been a good start,
for example.</p>

<h3 id="lifting">Lifting</h3>

<p>I have always suffered from a lack of motivation going to the gym: two steps
forward, one step back. This has caused my progress in the gym to be less than
it could have been, although I have made progress nonetheless. In the very
recent past due to my studying for Prelims (and spending time with my
girlfriend) I did not go to the gym regularly (at all) during Trinity term. But
I’m confident I will be able to make back my gains soon.</p>

<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>

<p>Being in Oxford for a year and cooking for myself every day has thrown me in
the deep end. I’ve taken to this task with aplomb. In the first few months I
got used to stir-frying with a wok (the first time I did it I set off the smoke
alarm), and afterwards I branched out to oven baking/roasting and finally
cooking soup and cooking in the pressure cooker.</p>

<p>The cooking highlight of my year was cooking 500 portions of chicken
rice. It was Jing Long who recruited me for this event, an “Asian Food
Festival” hosted by Jovin. Jing Long bought an enormous rice cooker that
purported to be able to cook 200 portions of rice. We filled it up with water
and used it to sous vide ten whole chickens at a time, and it came out quite
like the real thing. Unfortunately the rice cooker let us down—the rice was
not evenly cooked, raw in parts and mushy in others—but the chicken was gucci
juicy.</p>

<p>I plan to further improve my culinary skills with Jing Long this summer. We’re
going down to Jurong fish market this weekend at an ungodly hour—4am—to get
the freshest fish. We’re going to do sashimi and some other seafood, JL wants
to do chilli crab. I have a pressure cooker at home so I’m going to be
exploring all the recipes I can, particularly in making thick, rich soups and
broths.</p>

<p>Next year JL and I want to do a “tasting menu” where we pull out all the stops
every month and cook fine dining for people.</p>

<h2 id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</h2>

<h3 id="relationship">Relationship</h3>

<p>The largest interpersonal change in my life is that I am now in a relationship,
which has been very educational, quite challenging, and immensely rewarding.</p>

<p><img src="/img/judy_and_me/1.png" alt="at_formal" />
<img src="/img/judy_and_me/2.png" alt="punting" />
<img src="/img/judy_and_me/3.png" alt="in_sg" />
<img src="/img/judy_and_me/4.png" alt="x" /></p>

<p>A relationship takes up a lot of one’s time and I can better appreciate the
freedom one has as a single person. However I think our <em>raison d’etre</em> is to
have the free time to spend it with our loved ones: family, friends, and
oneself. So it is a balance between loving oneself (striving for
self-improvement) and loving others (giving to our loved ones). A life only
loving oneself is a very lonely existence, so it’s important to give back to
others after an extended period of monk mode.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to insinuate that getting into a relationship is purely selfless.
Obviously I derive pleasure and learning from a relationship. But
a relationship requires sacrifice that isn’t needed when one is single and
focused purely on improving oneself.</p>

<p>Here I’ll very frankly list out some of the challenges that I’ve faced despite
the fact that my blog is now read by more than one person, as I have a strong
commitment to honesty (telling only the truth) and openness (telling the whole
truth).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Low emotional sensitivity</li>
</ol>

<p>My fatal flaw is I am not able to divine the feelings of others.  This has
often made me say the wrong thing in the past but I think I’ve gotten better at
this. Right now the problem is that I am not able to tell when my girlfriend is
angry or sad at something I’ve done or not done. When we first got together
I told her of this weakness and stressed the need for her to tell me exactly
how she feels. To her credit she has done so to a great extent, although not
for everything—but this is still incredibly admirable, because it’s very hard
to bare one’s feelings and I am sometimes guilty of not doing this myself.</p>

<p>She has done her part. On my part, it’s not fair to ask her to hold herself up
to a standard that even I can’t reach; I have to further improve my emotional
sensitivity despite my innate ineptitude, as well as to hold myself to the
standard I asked of my girlfriend to communicate honestly what I feel.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conflict management</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve argued a couple of times. There are two aspects to this: first, how do
I not say or do things that will cause conflict; second, how do I best defuse
conflicts when they inevitably erupt?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick one’s battles</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no need to die on every hill; one can win battles and lose the war.
A relationship is predicated on give and take and if you want to win everything
you will lose your loved one. Nonetheless, there are of course important things
you want to change (the hills you’re willing to die on)</p>

<ol>
  <li>An uncertain future</li>
</ol>

<p>The prospect of a long-distance relationship is an uncertain one. We will not
be studying in the same university next year, and we live in different
countries.</p>

<p>I have to serve a bond with IMDA, so my future for at least the next 7 years is
completely fixed. I told her that circumstances dictate I will have
to walk this path with or without her; I won’t be able to move to the US or the
UK, for example. I had to tell her because I don’t want to give anybody false
hope, or for her to have any possible misapprehension about what staying with
me entails.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some closing thoughts</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a wonderful thing to be able to love and to be loved; where it’s
acceptable to be needy/clingy/emotionally dependent on another person. The
conventional wisdom is that one should not be clingy but I find that if one is
so independent then what really is the point of a relationship?</p>

<h3 id="friends">Friends</h3>

<p>I have forged friends</p>

<p>I really, really like my tutors. Bassel, Sergi, Tia, Ralf—absolutely fantastic.
Their enthusiasm for the subject really shows through. In particular, the
politics tutors really sold me on the subject, when I wasn’t expecting to like
it at all. I was fully planning to drop politics… but now find myself wanting
to do a quantitative thesis!</p>

<p>The tutorial on state paternalism was truly <em>life-changing</em>. It completely
systematised and clarified my worldview.</p>

<p>Once again, I’m grateful to have come to Oxford: the tiny student-teacher ratio
means that I can forge close relationships with my tutors that wouldn’t be
possible at NTU. We go for drinks in the college bar, for example. I even
invited Bassel over and cooked Mapo tofu and egg fried rice for him!</p>

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>I interned at iGlobe from January to May 2017. I did market research, due
diligence and wrote investment papers. I also wrote two programs, Form Letterer
and Form Emailer, using Python.</p>

<p>I did well securing a scholarship. IMDA may not have the cachet of MAS/EDB/PSC,
but it’s a very good fit with my interests and I think I will enjoy the work
there more if I am given sufficient latitude. I’ve harped on this before but I
derive significant happiness from being financially independent, no longer
having to ask my parents for any money. It’s good too to be able to sock away
some money every month to buy slowly my freedom.</p>

<p>I am now working in Next-Generation Platforms, specialising in the blockchain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I spent week 1 of 8 getting up to speed on the blockchain, and wrote a short
research paper on how to get different blockchains to interoperate with each
other.</li>
  <li>I am planning to spend the next few weeks developing the Hyperledger
blockchain for supply chain, first building the basic supply chain before
extending it to include features like tracking accidents, services, theft and
so on.</li>
  <li>I have been tasked to build a model that showcases the blockchain. This will
probably mean playing with model cars and trains and terrain, which promises
to be rather silly. Still, it’s a necessary step in order to get the layman to
understand what we are doing.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="future-plans">Future plans</h1>

<h2 id="summer-2018-julyseptember">Summer 2018 (July–September)</h2>

<p>I want to do a good job in my internships at IMDA.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to implement a blockchain;</li>
  <li>Do something else that is quite technical in my next internship with
Planning, or at least useful for my future.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to take, and finish, Algorithms II, and I plan to spend an hour a day on
it—no more, no less.</p>

<p>I borrowed the book Functional Programming with Haskell by Richard Bird and
I intended to finish it but this is looking unlikely.</p>

<p>I will participate in a Codeforces educational challenge every week, as a way
to utilise my theoretical knowledge on Algorithms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I want to enjoy my summer with my family, partner and friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to pursue cooking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to get to a competitive powerlifting total:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gymboxx 3 times a week</li>
      <li>Do some form of exercise every single day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="michaelmas-2018-octoberdecember">Michaelmas 2018 (October–December)</h2>

<p>I have more or less decided on the papers I’m going to offer for Finals. I’m
still waiting on the Department to approve my appeal to do a Politics thesis
without doing three other core Politics modules; Sergi and Tia are supportive,
and so are Rachel (Senior Tutor) and Katy (Academic Registrar). It will help if
I do well in my Prelims.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Micro</li>
  <li>Macro</li>
  <li>Quantatitive Economics</li>
  <li>Microeconomic Analysis</li>
  <li>Econometrics</li>
  <li>Political Sociology</li>
  <li>Theory of Politics</li>
  <li>(Thesis?)</li>
</ol>

<p>I’d love to take Game Theory and Behavioural Economics but I just don’t have
the space to fit them in. I wish I could drop Macro (Ian Crawford is in talks
with the PPE committee to do exactly this) but that won’t be available for our
year. If I could drop Micro I would take BE or GT right away.</p>

<p>I am keeping Theory of Politics because I want to have a bit of Philosophy in
my degree (I am doing PPE, after all) and because I do quite enjoy the
topics, particularly on negative/positive liberty and paternalism.</p>

<p>In Michaelmas term, there will be no excuse. I will be heading to Iffley thrice
a week and Merton gym thrice a week as well.</p>

<h2 id="medium-term-plans">Medium-term plans</h2>

<p>The next order of business is to <strong>secure an internship in my second year that
leads to a full-time job offer</strong>. I would like to secure a “tech” job (meaning
a job where I write code for the majority of my day), but failing that, would
love to join IB or consulting with a focus in tech.</p>

<h1 id="how-i-have-changed-since-2017">How I have changed since 2017</h1>

<p>Compared to 2017, I feel more confident in my own abilities and my personality.
There is a lot I can work on but I know now that there are people who like me
for who I am, not <em>despite</em> who I am. I am still very much rough around the
edges—I definitely could calibrate tact-being direct—but I am happy with
the general shape of me.</p>

<p>I’m happier than I was. Going to Oxford has given me a “low-grade” happiness
that’s not subject to hedonic adaptation. What that means is that occasionally
every couple weeks or so I’ll wake up, walk out of the door, and feel so
blessed to be here. This further cements my view that the things that truly
give me happiness isn’t things nor one-off experiences but
self-actualisation/self-improvement and having close relationships with my
loved ones.</p>

<p>Some examples of things that don’t give me much happiness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buying new clothes</li>
  <li>Buying new gadgets (SSD, phone, etc)</li>
  <li>Traveling</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one took a bit of soul-searching. I enjoy some sorts of traveling but
not others. I enjoy traveling that’s chill and relaxed, and when I’m going to
see beautiful natural sights. I’m a bit of a homebody; I don’t feel the need to
make the most of my time when I’m in a foreign country.</p>

<p>It was difficult to realise this because traveling seems to be something that
everyone agrees is meaningful and worthwhile. But I feel like traveling is yet
another form of consumption, albeit a form that’s somewhat more socially
acceptable than purchasing material goods. I think it’s incorrect to draw an
artificial dichotomy between the two; material goods can bring one lasting
happiness (or at least freedom from a lasting annoyance), while the experience
from traveling can be very ephemeral. I think the sort of traveling where you
hop around countries and take photos of everything briefly is rather
meaningless, but I do enjoy spending a long time in a country and meeting new
friends or learning about new cultures. I did enjoy greatly my BSP experience,
as well as my trip to Yunnan.</p>

<p>Some things that I have found do give me happiness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Having a sharp knife that makes kitchen prep easy</li>
  <li>Having a large pot and metal prep bowls</li>
  <li>Cooking (and eating) delicious meals</li>
  <li>Having a girlfriend</li>
  <li>Looking better</li>
  <li>Being around friends all the time</li>
</ul>

<p>Buying things make me happier insofar as they reduce or remove a consistent
annoyance I suffer from. Everything else seems to be experiential or
self-actualising. I am happy when I am the best that I can be, and I am happy
when I am around the people I love.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel more content and satisfied and happier than I was in 2017.
Thinking back to 2017, I was happy to have been done with NS, but not so happy
with the drudgery of my work and still worried about choosing between Oxford or
NTU. Now the grind and uncertainty still exists (I would never want it to go
away) but I feel far more secure in my life and future plans.</p>
