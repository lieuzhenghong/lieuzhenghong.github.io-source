<h2>Lieu Zheng Hong (or Zhenghong Lieu)</h2>

<p>I am reading Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Merton College.

<p>I use this site as a personal diary. In it I record my thoughts and
feelings, my views and goals, my struggles and triumphs. I like looking at my
old posts and see how I have changed. I particularly enjoy reading the
problems that faced me in the past and seeing how they were overcome (or not). 

<p>I am interested in exploring the following topics and have idiosyncratic
views regarding them: genetic selection for intelligence in humans, financial
planning for early retirement, and optimising what and how I eat to maximise
health and fitness.

<p>My interests are capricious but the ones I always come back to include
programming, eating, cooking and lifting weights.
