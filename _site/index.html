<h2>Lieu Zheng Hong (or Zhenghong Lieu)</h2>

<p>I am currently reading Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Merton College,
    and am looking for a software development internship for Summer 2019. My resume
    can be found at <a href="http://www.lieuzhenghong.com/resume">this very site</a>.</p>

<p>My interests are capricious but the ones I always come back to include
    programming, eating, cooking and lifting weights.</p>

<p>I am interested in exploring the following topics and have idiosyncratic
    views regarding them: embryonic genetic selection to increase human
    intelligence, financial planning for early retirement, and optimising what and
    how I eat to maximise health and fitness.</p>

<p>I use this page as a personal diary. In it I record my thoughts and
    feelings, my views and goals, my struggles and triumphs. I like looking at my
    old posts and see how I have changed. I particularly enjoy reading the
    problems that faced me in the past and seeing how they were overcome (or not).</p>
