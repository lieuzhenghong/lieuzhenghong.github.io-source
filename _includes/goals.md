It's interesting to see which goals I manage to complete and which goals are
left by the wayside.

I don't think there's anything inherently bad in setting goals and not
finishing them. The most important thing is identifying the goals that are
important and having the willpower to complete them, while paring ruthlessly
the goals that *seem* worthwhile but do not advance my long-term interests.

Of course, this doesn't give me an excuse to drop goals that are hard!
