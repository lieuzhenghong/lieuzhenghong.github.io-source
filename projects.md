# Projects
(This page is a work in progress)
I've built several pieces of software.

## Blockchain industry showcase
June 2018 -- present (ongoing)

Tech stack: Hyperledger Fabric/Composer, Node.js, JavaScript

Headed a project that persuades industry leaders to adopt blockchain in their
companies, after obtaining buy-in from senior management...

This is a fully-automated blockchain solution for supply chain
management with four different components:

1. Blockchain (powered by Hyperledger)
2. Real-time blockchain visualisation
3. Asset tracker (good viewer)
4. Model train diorama with IoT sensors (to showcase the system in action)

The way it works is ...

Built with Hyperledger, Node.js, HTML Canvas.

## Inspector's Gadget
August 2017

Inspector's Gadget is a bespoke desktop application written in ElectronJS
that was custom-built for a civil engineering consulting firm. It streamlines
the process of writing building inspection reports. Real-world usage reports
show that it decreases the time taken to write a report by up to 85%.

A building inspection report involves three things:

* Photos taken of the building
* Floor plan of the building
* PDF report of all building defects and recommended actions taken (if any)

A building inspection report is done as follows: the engineer walks around
the building and takes photos of all structural features and defects (if
any). The engineer will then annotate the floor plan, showing where the
defects are in the building. This software streamlines every part of the
process, from quick-tagging floor plans, automatic table generation and final
report generation.

## Form Emailer and Form Letterer
April 2017


A mini "software suite" that makes sending mass, personalised emails very
simple. I created it because I was too lazy to send emails manually when I was
an intern.

Form Letterer allows you to quickly generate Word documents from a template,
while Form Emailer lets you send personalised emails with different files
attached. They synergise as you can use Form Letterer to generate unique
documents and then send those documents in personalised emails with Form Emailer.

This project was borne out of the inadequacy of Outlook's Mail Merge. One of
the "killer features" this software suite has is the ability to send unique
attachments (a different attachment to each recipient), which Outlook Mail
Merge lacked. Another cool feature is it supports arbitrary Python code in
substitutions, which allows for amazing features Mail Merge just can't support
like conditional execution.

Written in Python.

## Automated Transaction Tracker
August 2016

This was the army's first item tracker and automatic SMS reminder system.  It's
written in React, Node.js, and uses MongoDB on the back end. The system
decreases administrative overhead by automatically keeping count of all items
in the store (item tracker), and sending SMSes to remind borrowers who have
borrowed items from the store but have not returned them in time. The system
will also automatically notify the supervisor of the store so that appropriate
disciplinary action can be taken.

This system won second prize in the Army's Annual Innovation Contest.

# Games

I've also built some silly games.

## Phonics Game
July 2018

An educational game for kids aged 7-8 to learn "vowel teams", made for the
Ministry of Education. I didn't know what a vowel team was
until I started this project.

Built with HTML Canvas and JavaScript, with art from the (extremely) talented
Shan Wei. Available to play [here](lieuzhenghong.com/phonics-game-poc).

## Dropship Chess
September 2017

A game built for the the Jack computer, a computer we build ourselves from
scratch (NAND gates) as part of the (excellent) course [From NAND to
Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course).

It's chess played on a 6x6 board where captured enemy pieces can be
"airdropped" anywhere on the board in lieu of moving a piece, kind of like
Shogi/Bughouse. White starts with two knights and Black with two bishopsâ€”so you
have to capture the opponent's knights/bishops to get your own.

Plugging the course here: NAND To Tetris is an excellent overview of computer
architecture. You start with a NAND gate, and then build other gates from there
like full adders. You then move on to building basic processing and storage
devices (ALU, RAM and CPU).  Then you build an assembler, then a VM, then an
interpreter, then a full-fledged parser/lexer and compiler, and finally an OS
which you write in a high level language you compile yourself! It's awesome.
