Yesterday, Bailin and I finished the build of the Raspberry Pi console.

This Raspberry Pi console project is the culmination of more than half a year of
effort. For the last eight months, I have been teaching the kids at Ulu Pandan
Stars Python (specifically Python Turtle). After much hand-holding and patient
instruction the kids were able to write the code for a Pong clone (mostly) all
by themselves. (We wrote the code that read from the GPIO pins). 

The kids don't understand all the concepts, however, which makes me think that
the project is a little too ambitious. For example, they have no idea what the
ADC does, how the wiring in the Raspberry Pi works and/or how the Raspi reads
the hardware inputs. I don't see this as *too* big a deal, though, because even
if they don't understand it, at least they know about it.

Nonetheless, the kids definitely *do* understand a lot of things: basic
programming concepts (functions, loops, conditionals), Cartesian coordinates,
event-based programming, and so on. We have also been training them to talk
about what they have done (the girls lack the confidence to speak in a formal
setting) but there's still a lot of work that still needs to be done.

## First draft ##

The project started as a 'shoebox console' but we found that a shoebox was way
too flimsy. Here's what that looked like: 
that instead.

We used an X-acto knife to cut the holes in the box and had to solder wires
onto the rheostats and the push buttons.

## Improved version ##
Bailin was able to buy a box file from Popular for $5 so we used that instead.

delicate parts.

My mom and my cousin playing with it: the game is buggy and I will get
Audrey and Gillian to fix it.

## Finishing up ##
Today I called for an extra lesson where I got the kids to mount the final two
buttons so they couldclaim to have done at least some of it themselves (instead
of having the tutors do all the work). Here's what the final version looks like
now:

Actually I still don't know how the thing is wired because Zheng Yang did the
lion's share of the work in wiring. I'll have to learn from Bailin how
everything is wired.

This was my first time working with a Raspberry Pi as well as hardware
components like rheostats and buttons: my previous projects were all
software-only. I'm very grateful to Zheng Yang and Bailin for helping so much
(it literally could not have been done without Zheng Yang).

The kids will finish their DSA exercise in August. Whether or not they get into
DSA is out of my control but I hope that they will have the confidence and
motivation to pursue similar projects in the future. STEM is the future, after
all...

## What's next ##

The kids should patch their games and do some bug-fixing.

I'd like to build a few 'demonstration games' on the console that make
good use of the two rheostats (an interesting input medium).

It's my hope that this console can be used as a springboard for future
programming lessons.
