# Things that happened

## Started TT 2019

I remember being eager to start TT 2019, as I only had QE. I was also looking
forward to working on my thesis. The weather was pretty nice---although not as
nice as last year---and I enjoyed myself greatly.

## Learned QE

QE was fun and challenging. I like probability a lot, and I really want to know
it very well. I liked how James Duffy taught QE in a rigorous way: everything
from first principles, mathematically derived, good stuff.

The things I learned in PolSoc were given a coat of mathematical rigour:
omitted variable bias, heterogeneity, endogeneity, etc.

I actually quite like time-series as well, even though we didn't really get
enough time to learn it.

It's five weeks into my summer vacation and I haven't started revising it yet,
in part because I've been busy with other things.

## Started planning my thesis and coming up with many ideas

Lots of fits and starts, wrong avenues, and interesting ideas I had to throw
away---in other words, par for the course for any research project.

My thesis started off with nebulous preferences I had. I had one main goal to
do a topic as quantitative and algorithmic and "codey" as possible (playing to
my comparative advantage + makes me look smart).  I had three initial ideas:

1. "Methods" paper: apply a new technique to political science, like use deep
   learning to predict voter turnout
2. "Takedown" paper: show that a published paper suffers from some flaws
3. "Proper" paper: what one's "supposed" to do: generate a hypothesis, gather
   some data, test the hypothesis and present one's findings.

There are pros and cons to each approach. A 'takedown' paper is relatively easy
to do , but unfriendly and makes little contribution to the literature. A
"proper" paper is how you're supposed to do it, but I didn't like the idea of
having to come up with an interesting question and gathering data and so on and
so forth... Lastly, a "methods" paper is the best of both worlds but is
difficult to come up with.

My first port of call was Tak Huen, who reads political science journals for
fun. He gave me four copies of *Political Analysis*. There was one paper that
excited me very much: *A New Approach for Developing Neutral Redistricting
Plans* by Magleby and Mosesson (2018), which opened my eyes to algorithmic
redistricting. I realised that a political science paper didn't have to be
boring. In fact it could closely resemble a computer science paper! My initial
thought was to think about a better algorithm for algorithmic districting, but
after a more comprehensive lit review I realised that this had already been
done to death, and there would be little chance of me coming up with anything
novel.

But algorithmic redistricting gave me some ideas. I spoke with Jarel, who did a
thesis on contestation in Singapore politics, and he mentioned that it would be
worth looking at algorithmic districting in the Singaporean context. Singapore
is rather unique in the sense that it has GRCS, multi-member constituencies.
Jarel pointed out that electoral disproportionality actually lies on a
spectrum. On the one hand, we have perfect PR systems. Then we have regular
FPtP systems, with single-member constituencies. At the extreme we have a
presidential vote, where there is only one seat.

Where we have perfect PR systems, seat share is exactly vote share. Where we
have a presidential system, whoever wins 51% of the vote controls 100% of the
government. FPtP systems are in the middle of the road, because while it's
theoretically possible for a party to win 51% in every district and control
100% of the government, this will be a statistically unlikely occurrence.

Singapore's unique GRC system moves it towards greater district magnitude:
obviously, by having a winner-takes-all GRC, there are less districts overall.

Now imagine you are the PAP, an incumbent government with > 50% of the popular
vote. In order to maximise your seats, your strategy is clear. Increase
district magnitude as much as possible! 

Therefore I wanted to ask the question: how has the GRC system benefited the
PAP's electoral fortunes? The only way to answer this with any degree of
certainty is to run simulations with alternative districting plans, and find
out how electoral outcomes might differ. It would be a very spicy paper if I
could show that under a set of fair districting plans, the PAP would have won X
less seats. Unfortunately, political concerns and the Singapore government's
reticience to release election data mean that I had to abandon the project.

But this led me to consider a more general question: how do number of
districts, district magnitude, voter homophily and malapportionment affect seat
share, holding vote share constant?

On 10th May 2019 (Trinity Week 3), I wrote the following:

> Holding constant voters’ preferences, I use a simulation approach to find out how
varying the number of districts and the way in which we draw districts affects
the seat share of the incumbent in a 2-party, first-past-the-post (FPtP) system.

> Motivation: a government can redraw electoral boundaries in many (not just
“cracking and packing”, but also the number of districts, how misapproportioned
a district is), and even (through for instance the HDB racial quotas) affect the
geographic distribution of citizens. To what degree does this help incumbents
like the PAP maintain their hegemony?

and brought it to Sergi. Sergi liked it, but said before embarking on a thesis,
to do the following:

> Please have a look at the following readings and come back to me
with a very succinct plan with 1- question (identifying a gap), 2- theory, 3-
hypothesis, 4- design. If you find an interesting reading, feel free to have a
look at their bibliography and pull interesting references to read as well.

Bassel has been absolutely the best person I've had in my life so far. He got
really interested in my problem, sending me tons of emails, sitting me down and
telling me how I should proceed. I really owe him a huge debt, and I wouldn't
even know how to begin repaying him.

Bassel and I spent three hours at his house, and we talked through the problem.
He gave very good advice --- simplify, simplify, simplify. Pare the research
question into one very focused question, and make as many simplifying
assumptions as possible. In my case, the most interesting question we
identified was: **How does voter homophily affect the ratio of vote share to seat
share?**

---

Then began over a month of false starts, dead ends, and hard thinking.

I started off thinking with Bassel how to quantify voter homophily. We tried a
ton of models, I ran a lot of simulations, but nothing quite seemed to work in
giving us the predictions we wanted. Intuition suggests that voter homophily
should affect seat share in a U-shaped manner. When all voters are uniformly
distributed, both parties win (on expectation) a number of seats proportional
to their vote share. When all voters are perfectly homophilous (i.e all red on
one side, all blue on another), both parties win exactly their vote share as
well (districts are all perfectly packed, 100/0).

Actually, that's not exactly true, is it? Suppose you're a minority party with
30% vote share. If all voters are uniformly distributed you will win pretty
much none of the seats. In this case, some clustering can help you win some
districts, and in fact plausibly even more districts than your vote share, if
your average cluster size is >50%. But if you cluster too much, all of a sudden
you're back to overwinning districts. Hence the inverted U-shape.

On May 20, Sergi said:

Then I looked at Jonathan Rodden's work, and realised there was one paper
incredibly similar to what we were doing, under 'spatial efficiency'. I wrote
to Bassel:

Bassel replied on 31st May, 2019:

Emboldened by Bassel's advice, I doubled down on the Rodden and Eubank paper.
I kept thinking about homophily, but also realised that there seemed to be a
natural extension. Rodden and Eubank introduce a measure of political
dislocation, and high values of political dislocation suggest gerrymandering.
But the natural question is of course---how high is too high? Some areas may
naturally have higher PDs than others, so there is no one-size-fits-all. One
approach to solve this simulation: calculate a distribution of observed PDs
from simulation, then see where the actual PD falls within that distribution.

I was pretty excited about this, and emailed Sergi about it on June 6, 2019.

A real shame indeed! Well, there was nothing to be done. I met Andy for the
first time and pitched both ideas to him. He was not so keen on the first, but
much more keen on the second. He said that the simulation approach was indeed a
very natural extension of their work, and he was surprised that they hadn't
done it already.

He said, let's email Jonathan Rodden and see if there are any opportunities for
collaboration. I was like wow --- that would be awesome, I didn't know you
could do that.

This was a nice message: although it did close the idea of simulation to me,
(they were already working on it), it was nice to know that I was on the right
track. Furthermore, he tossed out a couple of little ideas, and Andy told me to
run with them.

I am currently awaiting their reply, but I have strategic concerns. Is it a good
idea to do my thesis on a specific part of a specific measure of someone's
research paper, even if that person is Jonathan Rodden? I asked Andy this question, and he replied:

Some thoughts I had on the process:

First, I am incredibly thankful to Bassel, Filip, and Jarel, for ideating with
me. Especially a huge, huge thanks to Bassel, who has been so generous with his
time giving it to some spermling undergraduate like me for something that
doesn't concern him at all.

Second, "Deep thinking" is incredibly beneficial. I'll elaborate on this later.
But basically, I was able to come up with two problems/extensions of their
paper by lying on the bed, closing my eyes, and thinking really hard. I had
these ideas floating around inmy head, but it took a concerted effort to just
*think* in order for me to crystallise my intuitions, and come up with two
clear problem statements.

1. K-nearest neighbours algorithm doesn't take into account geographical
   features/state boundaries, and may also overstate partisan dislocation
2. PD is sensitive to voter clustering and can give false positives of
   gerrymandering if voters are sufficiently clustered.


## Started playing a bit of frisbee

After two years in Oxford, I'd settled into a routine. I'd wake
up, faff around, go for lunch, study a bit, go to the gym, cook dinner with
Martin, study a bit more, then go to sleep.

There are good things about having a routine. First of all, it's worked so far:
I'm reasonably productive. I am doing well (but not 100%) on my work. I enjoy
the food that I cook. I have a little bit of social interaction every day
(mainly with Martin lmao). I lead a very easy, stressless life.

However, the thing about having a routine is that it's very routine. It is at
odds with serendipity and doing new things and meeting new people. After I
broke up with Judy I was happy to be alone focusing on self-improvement ("monk
mode"), and so the routine fit me at the moment. But I knew that I would not
find anyone new in university if I continued this routine.

So I told myself that I would not allow myself to say no to anything. And thus
when Edelweiss asked me if I wanted to play frisbee with OUMSSA, I readily
agreed despite my initial hesitation.

This is why I have been playing some frisbee. I quite enjoy it so far, but I'm
incredibly unfit and will have to improve my cardiovascular fitness. 

## Sent Sergi off

On the 9th of June, Sergi very abruptly sent us this email:

> in comparative politics at the University of Glasgow, and this suddenly
> became my last term at Oxford. My wife has been offered the same position at

Sergi's not kidding---this is an incredible promotion for both him *and* his
wife. Full professor so young is seriously impressive! His teaching load will
go down significantly as well.

Sergi absolutely deserved it. He was *so* good as a tutor: he really, really
cared for me.

Here's an example. How other Oxford tutors usually mark our work: maybe few
ticks here and there and one paragraph at the end considered very good already.
On the other hand we had Sergi --- - my weekly essays were ~2000 words long,
and he'd always give feedback of 500-600 words at least, sometimes even 1000,
which is half the length of my essay! I always looked forward to his comments
on my work --- it was like receiving a Christmas present. And it was his
comments that spurred me to work harder and put more effort into my work, and
aim to improve every essay.

I know that he fought very hard for me last year when I was applying for
special dispensation to do a Thesis in Politics without doing three other
politics subjects.

And I wouldn't be surprised either if he was the one who recommended an
Exhibitionship to be given to me, even though I did not get a Distinction in
Prelims.

A poem came unbidden to my mind, and it struck me how apt it was for the
occasion. In this poem the poet and his close friend are both scholar-officials
posted far from their homes. The poet's close friend has received
a new, prestigious posting hundreds of miles away.

I translated it for Sergi's benefit, but I am of course no poet:

Sergi was a truly, truly exemplary tutor, and I am so sad to have to bid him
goodbye. I did not just lose a thesis advisor; I also lost a beloved teacher,
mentor and friend. It was truly my good fortune, and an absolute honour, to
have been his student these past two years.

See you soon, Sergi!

## Said goodbye to finalist friends

I consider the following people my (especially) good friends, and am incredibly
saddened to part with them. At least I will see the Singaporeans again.

- Tak Huen: my college father, who has done the most to welcome me to Merton.
  We always enjoy each other's company and conversation. Helped me immensely
  with a lot of things, too many to mention.
- Jarel: always up to help Jing Long and I with tasting food, cooking food, and
  moving food. Probably won me the Q-Step prize with his insight. Helped me
  find the first stepping stone for my thesis when I was lost.

From [last year's year in review post](/2018/07/01/2018-in-review):

> I must thank Jarel for speaking with me about my essay and providing me with my
key theoretical insight, which came serendipitously two days before the essay
deadline! I had ran the regressions earlier and were very frustrated that I
couldn't replicate Lijphart's results. But Jarel said that in and of itself is
a very significant finding! 

> Jarel: let me get this right: when you control for fixed effects, effects on gender
become insignificant --- right?

> Me: yes

> Jarel: ok that's a very strong result

> Jarel: i think i might have to rewrite the analysis bit as well

> Me: im very excited now actually because of what you pointed out

> Me: haha

- Sebastian: I go to college lunch to talk to him (and the free flow salad
  bar). Talking philosophy with him is edifying. Again, helped me a great deal
  with my thesis, and my goal to become a SWE.
- Jing Long: my partner in crime. I remember fondly our 3am-4am chats over tea,
  our 3am chicken rice prep, and our 2am tau huey prep. These are experiences
  that other people don't get to have, and I'm very lucky to have Jing Long as
  the "triad leader" bringing me along for the ride.

## Got a place in Guildford, Surrey

Now that I've started my internship, I really appreciate this place. The office
is a 6 minute bike ride from my house and Tesco's is also very close by. 

Guildford is very quiet. I am lonely and have no friends here. There is nothing
else to do but sleep, work, gym, and eat.... 

## Started my internship at Inzura

Thanks to Mrs Hauw, I was able to intern at Inzura.

I love my work. I'm currently working on two main projects, with a
third KIV if time permits. They are:

1. Use deep learning to imitate the outputs of an existing (highly-complicated)
   rule-based system---the Driver Profiler---without doing slow and expensive
   database lookups.
2. An intervention plan to triple the active users of a client company: Build a
   pipeline to send reminder SMSes to customers who have not installed the app,
   track who has clicked and who hasn't, and use Thompson sampling to converge
   optimally onto the most effective SMS.
3. (KIV) Program the cluster of 20 Raspberry Pis to perform distributed
   computing: MapReduce analysis on 2 million trips, running parallel copies of
   the Driver Profiler...etc.

# Life in review

Now that I have talked about the things that have happened, let's start the
review. I want to review every facet of my life this year, and also set a
course for the next.

## Values, purpose, character and identity

*What do I value?* *What* don't *I value? What do I believe in? What sort of
person am I? What sort of person do I want to be? Why am I here? What do I want
to achieve?*

I value the following traits: rationality, openness and honesty, intelligence,
intellectual curiosity, competence, diligence, ambition, and above all,
constant, relentless introspection and self-improvement, 

I value the following things: knowledge (in particular the use of knowledge to
make good decisions), free time (to spend with the people I love, and to pursue
my interests), having a healthy and aesthetic body, and eating and sleeping
well.

I hold the following beliefs (some more strongly than others): broad-strokes
consequentialism, paternalism, atheism, rationalism.

I don't value these things: money (and its trappings), power, status. (But see
below for musings on money and power).

### What sort of person am I?

If you asked me this question a few years ago I would have said that I was a
smart but lazy person.

Now I don't think I'm lazy anymore. This is because I can and do work very hard
on things that are important to me, often going above and beyond what a normal
"hardworking" person would do. For instance, I've put in a lot of effort into
my two theses and my internship.

I think I have a very one-track, binge-type personality. When I get interested
in something, it will consume my thoughts to a great degree, and I find it
difficult to be interested in anything else. It also manifests itself in my
addictions: occasionally I find myself bingeing clips of the Office or House
and being unable to stop until 6am in the morning. In contrast, if I am not
interested in something, then I will keep putting it off and it is very
difficult to get myself to do it.

I think I still have a very lazy 本性, possibly very poor self-discipline. It
is incredibly difficult for me to do the things I don't like to do or am not
interested in like laundry, or admin work. 

I'm a person who's very interested in knowledge and truth. I am a natural
skeptic. This often manifests itself as argumentativeness and disagreeableness,
which many find unpalatable. I understand (and have had first-hand experience
from Mark and Filip) that it is disheartening to have one's ideas shot down,
but this is how our brains usually work --- we focus on the negatives.

### What sort of person do I want to be?

I want to be a more open and honest person. I think it's Good to be open and
honest, and hopefully other people reciprocate. That doesn't mean saying mean
things for the sake of saying them, but it does mean saying mean things if
there is a good reason to do so.

I want to be a more generous person. To this end, I have started being more
open with my money. 

On myself: I know I have a frugal mindset and will not anyhowly buy things.
I've tried to be less price-conscious when buying important things (like e.g.
my trip to Finland and my trip to Romania---don't care just buy the ticket
only). I've tried to be less concerned about money in general e.g. not asking
to split groceries cost when inviting people over for dinner, which is again
something Judy mentioned.

I've been trying to treat my friends, like buying them dinner to show my
appreciation for them. I want to keep this up and improve upon this next year.

As a generalisation of that second fact, I want to be a more kind and selfless
person. I have a laser focus on my own self-improvement, but what about for
others? When I was with Judy I prioritised my self development over spending
time with her and making her feel loved.

How do I be a more kind and selfless person? There are not really any metrics
to measure this, are there?

One metric --- giving to charity.

It's important not to virtue signal. If I do give, I should tell no one.

### What am I here for? What do I want to achieve?

What's the point of life, anyway?

Broadly consequentially speaking, it's to maximise happiness (not the sort of
electrodes-in-brain happiness, but a notion of "higher-order" happiness, as
ill-defined as that might be).

I want my life on this earth to increase the happiness of those around me in
greater and greater concentric circles. First increase my own happiness, then
my family and friends, my fraternal organisations, and the wider world.

修身 齊家 治國 平天下

It may seem selfish to focus on myself and my immediate family first. Actually
I have been thinking quite hard about this: given my intelligence, interests,
personality and work ethic, I may have a chance of making a big impact on the
world. At the very least, were I to try and optimise for income, I could make a
lot of money and earn to give. The reason why I am trying to pursue early
retirement is because I believe it will me and my family members happier. But
maybe this is a selfish thing to do---maybe I have a moral obligation to not
retire early and instead make more money to give, or forget my family to start a
startup that changes the world.

But this is somewhat of a false dichotomy. Once I achieve financial
independence and retire, I don't plan to do nothing. In fact I probably still
plan to work very hard, because I enjoy working hard solving difficult,
interesting and impactful problems.

I'm not entirely sure what to think. I plan to have children, and I plan to
spend a lot of time with them. What is the right amount of time to spend with
one's children? If I spend too much time with them, I necessarily will neglect
my solving difficult, interesting and impactful problems. But if I spend too
little time with them, then I haven't really retired in the first place, have
I?

They say it takes a village to raise a child. So I had some
thoughts about the utopian village: a community of financially-independent
parents with different skills and backgrounds, and we'd get together to raise
children together. The children would be home-schooled in the best sense:
highly personalised instruction, yet without the social isolation that makes
many home-schooled kids a little weird. Can you imagine the fount of knowledge
that would be available to the children, and the amazing projects that could
happen?

The advantages of doing this is that it would scale by division of labour ---
instead of pouring my heart and soul into my one or two children, I could very
easily teach more, and my burden would also be lessened because the
workload can be shared. There are also knowledge complementarities.

Of course this is utopian --- nobody is going to buy into this idea apart from
me. But even if this never materialises I do want to give my children
opportunities to learn from the best --- for instance, if Tak Huen is in the
US, maybe I can fly over and let my kid learn from him for a week about
political science. Or Oskar or Rayhan could spark my kid's interest in quantum
mechanics. There are so many smart and passionate friends I have around me.
Imagine being a kid again, with all the time in the world, and neuroplasticity
--- how amazing that would be if the kid could be surrounded by all my smart
and passionate friends.

## Contribution and impact

In my not-very educated opinion, the three biggest priority problems are global
warming, poverty, and AI risk.

These problems are somewhat biased by saliency (saliency of my particular news
bubble), but I've tried to update my knowledge with reports from EA.

- How effective is embryo selection for tackling poverty? My intuition is that
  there are probably much more cost-effective interventions.
	- but this is surely very underserved and i might have a huge marginal
	  impact
	- not to mention the profit model exists here and it usually wouldn't for
	  other humanitarian interventions
- what is the conditional probability that a smart child from a poor family
  will succeed and break out of the cyclel?

global warming: huge problem, but my marginal impact is low

what are the biggest things I can do in my life to reduce my carbon emissions?

## Location and tangibles

Currently in Guildford, Surrey. Quiet place, no friends, a lonely existence.

But good place to hunker down and "monk mode".

Had to purchase some kitchen supplies to make myself able to withstand cooking.
One of the best purchases was a big pan.

Tangibles: in Oxford, I pretty much have everything. Huge stock of kitchen
equipment and supplies; have been slowly accumulating them over the years.

I can cook basically anything in any style apart from sous vide: I can steam,
blanch, roast, bake, pan sear, pan-fry, stir-fry, deep-fry... 

I want to get rid of some of my old clothes that are too small or have become
discoloured.

I have too many files and books, but I like files, I like paper stuff.

Next year: I was originally worried about having too much stuff, but I realised
that Martin will happily take all my cooking stuff when I leave.

## Money and finances

I've done really well in this domain. Both spending and investing are on
autopilot, and I haven't had to worry. 

I no longer keep a day-to-day budgeting log, but I'll have to go through this
year's spending, and see how much I can take out of my allowance to invest.

---

OK, I've just looked through my spending. So scholarship has given me a total
of 55k. I've spent 29k over a period of 6 terms and 5 holidays (MT 17/18, HT
18/19, TT 18/19), and invested the surplus (25k).

I spend about 3.5k every term or 2k pounds, that's 21k over 6 terms. I have
spent 8k on holidays, which is around 1.5k per holiday on average. (sounds
about right: 2.3k for MT2018 and 1.5k for HT2019)

I have 3 more terms to go: that's 6k more pounds, or 10.5k SGD. Including the
holidays, it should be around 15k SGD. That means I should have 9,000 GBP in my
accounts, and the rest can go to investment.

## Career and work

I'm very pleased with my internship, and very thankful to Mrs Hauw and Richard
for giving me this opportunity. 

I love my work.

Why?

Novel: I'm learning new technologies and touching new stuff every day. In the
span of two weeks I had to learn relational algebra, how to write a deep
learning pipeline, how to use Keras to build a deep learning model, multi-armed
bandit algorithms, etc.

Challenging and interesting: The projects are very interesting and challenging,
and the faster I learn, the faster I go. There's thus this huge internal drive
to push myself to learn as much as I can. The projects also dovetail well with
my schoolwork: I was able to connect the SMS intervention program to loss
aversion in BEE, and it could be one of the experiments in my thesis.

Open-ended, no blockers: Richard tells me what projects to work on, but the
projects are very open-ended. This suits someone like me, who learns quickly:
if I put modesty to the side for a bit, I feel like any one of the projects
could have taken a lesser mortal (kek) 8 weeks.  But part of it is that I work
independently---there are few if any blockers, I can go as fast as I want, and
I have enormous latitude to tackle the problems the way I see fit.  Because the
projects are very open-ended, I have to plan the "grand strategy" or "grand
plan" of how everything will work and how everything fits together, which I
find very rewarding. Talk to Anthony Masih about this --- he's a systems
engineer.

No bullshit work: I haven't been given any admin or accounting or intern "get
coffee for us" type of jobs. I've been treated very much like a full member of
staff. In fact I feel like I get preferential treatment because as the "data
scientist", Richard makes the SWE team bend over backwards to give me data.

Very short commute: It takes me literally 10 minutes by cycle to get to my
work. I was very lucky to have found a room very near to work.

Of course, no job is perfect. There are a few things that are non ideal:

There's not really anyone to learn from: I'm the only "data scientist" on the
team, and I really wish there was a senior or Chief Data Scientist I could
learn from. As it stands, nobody really checks my data science or deep learning
work, and when I get stuck on statistics or deep learning there's only the
Internet to learn from. (On the other hand, my colleagues are a great help if I
have programming or software engineering questions.) 

Not much welfare: Celine's internship has "tech days" every Friday, and she
started her internship off with a stay at a 5-star hotel in the Alps. I think
she recently went for a brewery trip and free dinner as well. On the other
hand, my workplace orders in three pizzas every Friday. (This complaint of mine
is half-facetious.)

After only two weeks, I really like my work, and am seriously considering
applying to do data science as a Master's. I was thinking that I may make a
stronger application to data science compared to computer science, which is a
field where I have no comparative advantage whatsoever.

## Health and fitness

I haven't been nearly as consistent as I would've liked in going to the gym. However I think I've picked up several habits that are making me healthier:

 **Sleeping and waking up early every day (going to lectures/work without
 having to set an alarm).**

This is the biggest change: not sure what exactly sparked it,

At the start of Trinity I realised that I have very bad mobility, and
horrendous internal shoulder rotation. This is without a doubt caused by my
penchant for benching a lot and my aversion towards any sort of horizontal
pulling exercise (rows and deadlifts). I still don't like deadlifts but I've
been trying to row three times a week.

I actually got an injury! Very interestingly I was at OXCAR practice, and I
tried to do two-finger pull ups on a door frame. All of a sudden I heard a loud
"snap", I fell to the floor, and felt a throbbing pain in my left ring finger.

Like an idiot, I actually jumped up and tried to do the same thing again. It
hurt (even more), so I stopped.

Two weeks and several clinic visits later, I found out that I had actually
partially ruptured my *flexor digitorum profundus* ("deep bender of the
fingers") tendon, on the distal phalange (last joint of the finger).

I was advised not to do any more finger-only pull-ups on a door frame, which I
suppose is prudent advice. Nearly three months later, it still hasn't recovered
fully; so I've laid off climbing in the meantime. 

As mentioned, I've also been playing frisbee, trying to get my resting HR down
because bradycardia == fit, right?

## Education and skill development

This year I did:

1. Micro
2. Polsoc
3. Macro
4. Theory of Politics
5. QE
6. Thesis in Politics
7. Behavioural and Experimental Economics

I didn't work very hard for Micro or Macro, which is nonideal. In Hilary Term I
really slacked off a lot; somehow that term I wasn't able to be productive and
motivated.

I worked very hard on PolSoc, thinking that I would do some PolSoc for my
thesis, but it turns out that my thesis will be on something completely
different. (I don't really find PolSoc interesting; this is despite it being
taught incredibly well by Sergi).

I have the summer to work on QE and my two theses. I need to grok probability
very, very well---firstly, because it's difficult and cool; secondly, it's the
foundation of QE, and I believe that once I understand probability deep in my
bones I'll be able to do the rest of QE easily; thirdly, I have very recently
become interested in Bayesian inference, and a firm grounding in probability --
in particular the maths behind conditional probability --- will be necessary.

I am proceeding at a good pace for my two theses. However, I am being blocked
for both of them.

For my thesis in Politics, I recently messaged Jonathan Rodden...

I am proceeding at a good clip for Behavioural Economics.

I am not sure how much Econometrics will help in my application compared to
Game Theory. But I'm thinking that having fun is more important. So still more
keen on Game Theory for now.

**Do I need a Master's?**

Pros and cons of doing a Master's:

Things I think I have a reasonable grasp on (comparable to a decent but not
top-tier undergrad who's done a course on it):
- Programming experience
- Comfort with the command line and Unix utilities
- Algorithms (complexity analysis, divide and conquer, dynamic programming,
  graph search..)
- Data structures (arrays, trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps and queues, ...)
- Probability and statistics (from QE)
- Machine learning and deep learning (from Andrew Ng and work experience)

Things I have some exposure to, but I don't think I am competitive at:
- Programming concepts (functional programming, recursion) 
- Computer architecture (N2T I & II, but no pipelining or memory hierarchy)

Things I lack in my education:
- Linear algebra
- Multivariate calculus (some experience in Micro: constrained optimisation, Lagrangian)
- Operating systems
- Networking
- Databases
- Distributed systems



The big question is:

**How can I make the most competitive application to a top-tier Master's
program in three months' time?**


I should start to 

GRE --- find test dates ASAP, and have to mug for it.

Looks like this summer will be incredibly busy!

All the Master's programs have one thing in common: they all say that
understanding of probability/statistics, linear algebra and calculus is
critical.

So I need to have worked though courses in linear algebra and calculus. There
is a Coursera specialisation on it and I think I will apply for IMDA funding.

From the CMU Master's in Computational Data Science:

The application requires a statement of purpose. What makes a good essay?

We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in
our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example,
a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the
project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of
what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your
professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to
explain any apparent weaknesses in your application.

In conclusion, I think that following this game plan will best increase my
chances of a successful application:

1. Start practicing for GRE, book test date, possible retest
2. Start learning linear algebra and calculus (from Coursera specialisation,
   Strang's lectures, and Coding the Matrix
3. Demonstrate competence in linear algebra, possibly by doing a project
   ('de-perspectivising' videos?)
4. Demonstrate competence in multivariate calclus --- maybe by writing a primer
   on Bayesian 
5. Make use of my internship to kill two birds with one stone: do BEE AND make
   sure internship is related to data science AND learn as much as I can as
   possible (the equivalent of an undergraduate course: networking, databases,
   distributed computing)
6. Document, document, document---I do a lot of good work, but I have to write
   down exhaustively what I did, and why it's impressive

## Social life and relationships

Judy: I have said enough.

Finalist friends: Some of the people whom I consider my best friends are
leaving/have left. As mentioned, Jarel, Jing Long, Tak Huen and Sebastian have
helped me so incredibly much, and I'm indebted to them. (Why are all of them
Asian males??? Is it I racist???) I will miss the other finalists too,
especially Venla, my college mother.

Sergi: See above. I feel a deep sense of loss. He was an exemplary tutor
and mentor.

## Emotions and well-being

Good state.

Breakup has affected me, but not to a large extent. I was able to find closure
relatively quickly.

## Productivity and organisation

I haven't really been very productive throughout the year (Easter was
especially lazy), but this summer has picked up. I found a new
productivity/organisation tool, Complice, and discovered the power of deep
thought.

### Discovered Complice

Three reasons why it works especially well for me:

1. Setting long-term goals and logging to-do items that work towards those
   goals helps keep me focused on the big picture (and remind me not to neglect
   one goal in favour of another, which I am wont to do)
2. Daily to-do lists log my progress, which is something I've been doing in an
   analogue manner anyway
3. Study room of like-minded people I can ask for advice/help

### Discovered the awesome power of deep thought

By this I mean if I lie down and close my eyes and do nothing except think
really hard for half an hour, I can solve difficult problems.

Something that also helps me is talking to others about it, although I'm not
sure if this is me solving the problem or them solving the problem.

One of the things I really like to do is to have college lunch and then retire
to OWL's reading room. I'll lie down on the couch, put a book over my face,
close my eyes and think about a problem that I've been having (usually thesis),
and drift off to sleep. When I wake up, I've usually thought of a solution (or
a possible approach) to the problem.

Now I didn't really think much of this until I was able to harness it more
consciously recently.

Two breakthroughs:

- One in thesis where I thought of two extensions to the partisan dislocation measure

As mentioned, one of my initial ideas was to use simulation to compare an
observed PD value under a specific districting plan with a reference
distribution of PD values under different districting algorithms. It turns out
that Rodden had already been working on this with his co-authors, so I couldn't
do it.

That left me with my second idea. I had a very sketchy outline in my head/very
weak intuition about criticisms with the PD informed by my previous exploration
with it, but nothing concrete.  However, I lay on the bed, closed my eyes and
thought about the problem for 1 pomo. I kept honing back to the question and
forced myself not to think in circles, and I was able to have

- One in behavioural econ when I got the intuition of updating joint probability

I was thinking about updating a contextual bandit (a bandit where the payoffs
are determined not just by the arm you pull, but other *contextual* factors
e.g. day of the week, weather, etc). I didn't quite understand how it worked,
but with a comment from Vanessa, and thinking about it in my head, I basically
came up with a visualisation.

So in a normal bandit you have a prior distribution. This could be a beta
distribution (see my post about it
[here](/2019/07/12/bayesian-inference-thompson-sampling-and-the-mab.html).  As
you get more information, you update the beta distribution. What that looks
like graphically is the curve moves and becomes more peaked as you make more
pulls. We can do this because the beta distribution is the conjugate prior
probability distribution for the Bernoulli/binomial distributions: that is, if
we start with a beta distribution and we update it with a Bernoulli
distribution, we get another beta distribution. I know I'm not explaining
clearly here but that's not the point of the post.

What does updating the contextual bandit look like? The simplest contextual
bandit is with one context with two possible states (say rain or shine). One
might be tempted to model it as simply two beta distributions. Start with two
uninformative priors. Then pull an arm, record whether it is a sunny or rainy
day when you pull it, and observe the result. It would look very similar to the
original scenario, except in this case you have 2 distributions for each arm.

But this doesn't quite work either, because the contexts are not independent.
Meaning to say --- pulling arm 1 when it's sunny tells you *something* about
the payoffs of pulling arm 1 when it's rainy. You have to update *all* contexts
of the arms, not just the one. But how do you do that, and how does that look
like visually?

I had no idea at the start. But after thinking about it, I realised. You use a
*joint* distribution. And what that looks like with one context is a 3D graph,
where the x- and y-axes are probability and context, and the z-axis is density.
We have merely added a new y-axis for context. One can think of the start
(uninformative prior) as a sandpit full of sand, and as we update we shift the
sand around to reflect the new information.

The point of these two anecdotes is: Deep thought is really powerful, and being
able to generate insights from closing my eyes and lying down and thinking
makes me feel like I have a superpower. This is something that I find harder
and harder to come by especially with my phone close to me---thinking is
*hard*, and my brain doesn't want to do it, and it finds tons of ways to put it
off, or go in circles, or find literally *anything* to get out of thinking. But
the dividends are great. They give me gestalts and insights that I cannot get
another way.

I need to allocate time every so often for deep thought. Things that require it
most right now: my thesis, my future plans, architecting software systems,
figuring out what I want in life.

## Adventure and creativity

- Frisbee: as part of trying to be more serendipitous, I said "yes" to
  Edelweiss when she asked me if I wanted to join the OUMSSA frisbee hangout.
  It has been really fun and I have been getting better, and I hope to continue
  it casually next year.
- Started painting: We had a new artist-in-residence organise a couple of
  workshops, so I made sure to go to all of them. I have always been interested
  in painting, viewing it as a natural extension of my calligraphy (and it
  would also make the cards I write for others nicer/more beautiful). It was
  nice --- I got a painting of some flowers to show for my effort. I definitely
  want to do more of this next year.

# Conclusion

This year has been wonderfully kind to me. I continue thriving at Oxford--- I
am relishing the company of my close friends, immersing myself deeply in
interesting, challenging academic work, and enjoying the spare time I have to
live life in an unharried, serendipitous manner.

I grew as a person dating Judy. She precipitated a sea change in my attitude
towards money. The relationship has given me much more clarity about the kind
of person I would best click with.

My scholarship continues to give me money, which has allowed me to be
blissfully insulated from pecuniary worries. I have become financially secure
and I now want to make a deliberate attempt to be generous towards my friends
and family.

My internship is very interesting and challenging, and has just the right
balance of structure and open-endedness to hook me. The CEO, Richard, is
gregarious and really knows his stuff. Having done a bit of data science at my
internship, I think I'm happy to pursue it as a Master's degree.

I picked up a new productivity habit (Complice), and it helps that my thesis
and BEE mini-thesis are chugging along nicely.

Overall, I'm in a good place. My self-esteem is high because of my social
relationships and academic success. No troubles due to financial stability. Good
internship thanks to my eternal benefactor Mrs Hauw.

I made a comment [two years ago](/2017/08/22/life-report-aug-2017.html):

> The grind never ends—not after my As, not during army, not even after I have

> need this grind in my life more than I think I do.

If only I knew how true this comment would prove to be---I'm still grinding
away today.
