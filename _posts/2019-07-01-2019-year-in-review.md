# Life in review

## Values and purpose
## Contribution and impact
## Location and tangibles
## Money and finances
## Career and work
## Health and fitness

Realise that I have very bad mobility, and horrendous internal shoulder
rotation. This is without a doubt caused by my penchant for benching a lot and
my aversion towards any sort of horizontal pulling exercise (rows and
deadlifts). I still don't like deadlifts but I've been trying to row three
times a week.
