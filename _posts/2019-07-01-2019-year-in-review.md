# Life in review

## Values, purpose, character and identity

*What do I value? What *don't* I value? What do I believe in? What sort of
person am I? What sort of person do I want to be? Why am I here? What do I want
to achieve?*

I value the following traits: rationality, openness and honesty, intelligence,
intellectual curiosity, competence, diligence, ambition, and above all,
constant, relentless introspection and self-improvement, 

I value the following things: knowledge (in particular the use of knowledge to
make good decisions), free time (to spend with the people I love, and to pursue
my interests), having a healthy and aesthetic body, and eating and sleeping
well.

I hold the following beliefs (some more strongly than others): broad-strokes
consequentialism, paternalism, atheism, rationalism.

I don't value these things: money (and its trappings), power, status.


### What sort of person am I?

If you asked me this question a few years ago I would have said that I was a
smart but lazy person.

Now I don't think I'm lazy anymore.

I think I still have a very lazy 本性, possibly very poor self-discipline. It
is incredibly difficult for me to do the things I don't like to do or am not
interested in, like laundry, or admin work.

### What sort of person do I want to be?

I want to be a more open and honest person

I want to be a more generous person. To this end, I have started being more
open with my money. 

On myself: I know I have a frugal mindset and will not anyhowly buy things.
I've tried to be less price-conscious when buying important things (like e.g.
my trip to Finland and my trip to Romania---don't care just buy the ticket
only). I've tried to be less concerned about money in general e.g. not asking
to split groceries cost when inviting people over for dinner 

I've also been trying to treat my friends, like buying them dinner to show my
appreciation for them. I want to keep this up and improve upon this next year.

As a generalisation of that second fact, I want to be a more kind and selfless
person. I have a laser focus on my own self-improvement, but what about for
others? When I was with Judy I prioritised my self development over spending
time with her and making her feel loved.

How do I be a more kind and selfless person? There are not really any metrics
to measure this, are there?

One metric --- giving to charity.

It's important not to virtue signal. If I do give, I should tell no one.

### What am I here for? What do I want to achieve?

What's the point of life, anyway?

Broadly consequentially speaking, it's to maximise happiness (not the sort of
electrodes-in-brain happiness, but a notion of "higher-order" happiness, as
ill-defined as that might be).

I want my life on this earth to increase the happiness of those around me in
greater and greater concentric circles. First increase my own happiness, then
my family and friends, my fraternal organisations, and the wider world.

## Contribution and impact

In my uneducated opinion, the three biggest priority problems are global
warming, poverty, and AI risk.

- How effective is embryo selection for tackling poverty? My intuition is that
  there are probably much more cost-effective interventions.
	- but this is surely very underserved and i might have a huge marginal
	  impact
	- not to mention the profit model exists here and it usually wouldn't for
	  other humanitarian interventions
- what is the conditional probability that a smart child from a poor family
  will succeed and break out of the cyclel?

global warming: huge problem, but my marginal impact is low

what are the biggest things I can do in my life to reduce my carbon emissions?

## Location and tangibles

Currently in Guildford, Surrey. Quiet place, no friends, a lonely existence.

But good place to hunker down and "monk mode".

Had to purchase some kitchen supplies to make myself able to withstand cooking.
One of the best purchases was a big pan.

Tangibles: in Oxford, I pretty much have everything. Huge stock of kitchen
equipment and supplies; have been slowly accumulating them over the years.

I can cook basically anything in any style apart from sous vide: I can steam,
blanch, roast, bake, pan sear, pan-fry, stir-fry, deep-fry... 

I want to get rid of some of my old clothes that are too small or have become
discoloured.

I have too many files and books, but I like files, I like paper stuff.

## Money and finances

Good - investing is on autopilot

Spending is also on autopilot

I no longer keep a budgeting log, but I'll have to go through this year's
spending, and see how much I can take out of my allowance to invest.

---

OK, I've just looked through my spending. So scholarship has given me a total
of 55k

I've spent 29k over a period of 6 terms and 5 holidays (MT 17/18, HT 18/19, TT 18/19).
25k went to IWDA.

I spend about 3.5k every term or 2k pounds, that's 21k over 6 terms, 8k for
holidays (sounds about right: 2.3k for MT2018 and 1.5k for HT2019)

I have 3 more terms to go: that's 6k more pounds, or 10.5k SGD. Including the
holidays, it should be around 15k SGD.

Next Hilary will be spent in Oxford, but summer should be fun.

## Career and work

I'm very pleased with my internship, and very thankful to Mrs Hauw and Richard
for giving me this opportunity. 

I'm currently working on two main projects, with a third KIV if time permits.
They are:

1. Use deep learning to imitate the outputs of an existing (highly-complicated)
   rule-based system---the Driver Profiler---without doing slow and expensive
   database lookups.
2. An intervention plan to triple the active users of a client company: Build a
   pipeline to send reminder SMSes to customers who have not installed the app,
   track who has clicked and who hasn't, and use Thompson sampling to converge
   to the most effective SMS.
3. (KIV) Program the cluster of 20 Raspberry Pis to perform distributed
   computing: MapReduce analysis on 2 million trips, running parallel copies of
   the Driver Profiler...

Why?

Novel: I'm learning new technologies and touching new stuff every day. In the
span of two weeks I had to learn relational algebra, how to write a deep
learning pipeline, how to use Keras to build a deep learning model, multi-armed
bandit algorithms, etc.

Challenging and interesting: The projects are very interesting and challenging,
and the faster I learn, the faster I go. There's thus this huge internal drive
to push myself to learn as much as I can. The projects also dovetail well with
my schoolwork: I was able to connect the SMS intervention program to loss
aversion in BEE, and it could be one of the experiments in my thesis.

Open-ended, no blockers: Richard tells me what projects to work on, but the
projects are very open-ended. This suits someone like me, who learns quickly:
if I put modesty to the side for a bit, I feel like any one of the projects
could have taken a lesser mortal (kek) 8 weeks.  But part of it is that I work
independently---there are few if any blockers, I can go as fast as I want, and
I have enormous latitude to tackle the problems the way I see fit.  Because the
projects are very open-ended, I have to plan the "grand strategy" or "grand
plan" of how everything will work and how everything fits together, which I
find very rewarding. Talk to Anthony Masih about this --- he's a systems
engineer.

No bullshit work: I haven't been given any admin or accounting or intern "get
coffee for us" type of jobs. I've been treated very much like a full member of
staff. In fact I feel like I get preferential treatment because as the "data
scientist", Richard makes the SWE team bend over backwards to give me data.

Very short commute: It takes me literally 10 minutes by cycle to get to my
work. I was very lucky to have found a room very near to work.

Of course, no job is perfect. There are a few things that are non ideal:

Not really anyone to learn from:

After only two weeks, I really like my work, and am seriously considering
applying to do data science as a Master's. I was thinking that I may make a
stronger application to data science compared to computer science, which is a
field where I have no comparative advantage whatsoever.

## Health and fitness

I haven't been nearly as consistent as I would've liked in going to the gym. However I think I've picked up several habits that are making me healthier:

 **Sleeping and waking up early every day (going to lectures/work without
 having to set an alarm).**

This is the biggest change: not sure what exactly sparked it,

At the start of Trinity I realised that I have very bad mobility, and
horrendous internal shoulder rotation. This is without a doubt caused by my
penchant for benching a lot and my aversion towards any sort of horizontal
pulling exercise (rows and deadlifts). I still don't like deadlifts but I've
been trying to row three times a week.

I actually got an injury! Very interestingly I was at OXCAR practice, and I
tried to do two-finger pull ups on a door frame. All of a sudden I heard a loud
"snap", I fell to the floor, and felt a throbbing pain in my left ring finger.

Like an idiot, I actually jumped up and tried to do the same thing again.

It turns out that I had actually 

As mentioned, I've also been playing frisbee, trying to get my resting HR down
because bradycardia == fit, right?

# Conclusion

This year has been wonderfully kind to me. I continue thriving at Oxford--- I
am enjoying the company of my close friends, immersing myself deeply in
interesting, challenging academic work, and having the spare time to live life
in an unharried, serendipitous manner.

I grew as a person dating Judy. She precipitated a sea change in my attitude
towards money. The relationship has given me much more clarity about the kind
of person I would best click with.

My scholarship continues to give me money, which has allowed me to be
blissfully insulated from pecuniary worries. I have become financially secure
and I now want to make a deliberate attempt to be generous towards my friends
and family.

My internship is very interesting and challenging, and has just the right
balance of structure and open-endedness to hook me. The CEO, Richard, is
gregarious and really knows his stuff. Having done a bit of data science at my
internship, I think I'm happy to pursue it as a Master's degree.

I picked up a new productivity habit (Complice), and it helps that my thesis
and BEE mini-thesis are chugging along nicely.

Overall, I'm in a good place. Self-esteem is high because of my social
relationships, academic success. No troubles due to financial stability. Good
internship thanks to my eternal benefactor Mrs Hauw.

I made a comment [two years ago](/2017/08/22/life-report-aug-2017.html):

> The grind never ends—not after my As, not during army, not even after I have
> gotten my scholarship. But I am beginning to realise that I may like and even
> need this grind in my life more than I think I do.

If only I knew how true this comment would prove to be.
