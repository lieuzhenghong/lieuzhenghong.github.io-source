# Results of Master's applications

I was rejected from ETH Zurich's Data Science course, Stanford's Data Science
course, and CMU's Computational Data Science course. I was also rejected from
the ETH Zurich and Stanford Knight-Hennessy scholarships

I was accepted to ETH Zurich's Statistics course, Oxford's Statistical Science
course, and Harvard's Data Science course.

My top choice would have been Stanford's Data Science course, especially with
the scholarship. But I am happy with all of them, and very pleased to have
gotten a choice of three. I decided on Harvard in the end because I think the
marginal gain to staying in Oxford for another year is quite low, despite the
fact that I've enjoyed myself very much. ETH Zurich would also have been really
nice, but I chose Harvard over ETH for three reasons: i) I've been told that
the brand name of Harvard is stronger; ii) if IMDA is paying for my studies,
then the low cost of ETH Zurich is not worth the extra year of bond; iii)
studying in Harvard gives an opportunity for me to intern and work in the US.
However, there were pros to ETH Zurich as well. I'd be eligible for Swiss
employment having studied in a Swiss university (Swiss labour laws mandate that
employers scour the entirety of Switzerland and Europe and make sure that no
non-foreign worker can fill the role before allowing employers to hire a
foreign employee), and I would get to learn German with less friction. It was a
difficult decision and I would have been happy with any of these acceptances,
so I consider myself lucky. I am very grateful to Bassel, Sergi, Nick/Jonathan,
and Andy, who wrote me strong letters of recommendation that certainly helped
my admissions.

# Finals 2020

Eight papers: three core Econs, two Econs options (BEE/GT), three politics
papers (Thesis, Theory, PolSoc). I was allowed to take one less Politics paper
and do a thesis, which was very nice indeed---thank you to Sergi and Tia for
putting in a good word for me to the Senior Tutor, the Academic Registrar, and
the Politics department.

The papers I took were as follows:

1. Macroeconomics
2. Microeconomics
3. Quantitative Economics
4. Game Theory
5. Theory of Politics
6. Political Sociology
7. Thesis in Politics
8. Behavioural and Experimental Economics

I'll first write about the new examination arrangements due to the coronavirus
before talking about the individual papers.

## Coronavirus uncertainty, safety net, and new examination arrangements 

In March 2020 the coronavirus pandemic swept across Europe and many countries
started the lockdown. All of the undergraduates were unceremoniously kicked out
by Merton, given only a weekend's notice. Many of them left their things in
their rooms and left. I was allowed to stay because I was from (what was at the
time) a "Cat 1 country", ergo a country that was "heavily affected by the
pandemic". I think in those days the countries/areas were China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, South Korea, and Italy.

Until now I really cannot understand why Merton reacted in this way. I have
heard that Merton was one of only two colleges (the other being Magdalen) to
send all its international undergraduates home, and they were very harsh about
it. Other colleges like Corpus and even the official university advice said
that international students were welcome to stay.

In the midst of the lockdown and all the restrictions Singapore issued an
advisory encouraging students abroad to return home. The anxiety of coronavirus
swept over everyone, and I was inundated with many calls and emails and
WhatsApp messages from IMDA, friends, and family asking me to go home. But I
really did not want to, for three reasons:

1. There were only ten weeks left to finals, and if I were to go back home, I
   would lose precious time for revision: two weeks in self-quarantine (while
   being very jet-lagged), then having no conducive space to study (libraries,
   cafes, etc. were all closed);
2. Heathrow was packed to the brim, while Oxford was very empty. I was unlikely
   to get the coronavirus if I stayed put, but the chance of catching it would
   go up a lot if I started traveling on the crowded trains, going to the
   crowded airport terminal, sitting in the crowded airplane... and so on.
3. Celine felt very anxious and unmoored due to the coronavirus
   situation (the sudden departure of all our friends, the uncertainty of our
   examination arrangements, having Trinity term snatched away from us, not
   knowing whether I'd be called to go home), and I wanted to stay with her and
   keep her company.

At that moment we didn't know if Trinity Term would be conducted remotely, and
didn't know what form the examinations would take. There was significant
discussion on the PPE cohort group chat. Some universities/courses cancelled
finals entirely and graded purely on the basis of tutorial work/coursework.
Other universities like UCL gave a 24-hour take-home exam. I helped another
PPEist draft [an open letter to the
examiners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CenS3T54L0S_Y3pmqCpFYyxsuy15RipSbwDf_SpKL_s/edit)
appealing for the University to allow for student choice in assessments: that
is, to accept either open-book exams under conventional time limits, a
submission of coursework with more relaxed time limits, postponing the exams
for the start of MT2021 or TT 2021, or even to take a "declared to have
deserved honours" with an unclassified degree. The reason for doing so is
because no one-size-fits-all solution exists. Some students may not have a
quiet environment in their homes to take a timed online exam, and may prefer a
take-home exam; others may need to take care of family members and want to
defer their exams completely; yet others may simply prefer to take the exams in
the format they've prepared for.

There was also a Student Union survey asking for our most preferred choice. In
the end, I don't think anything much transpired out of it. The vast majority of
students preferred being assessed by take-home exams and/or coursework. Timed
4h exams were actually the least popular option. Nonetheless, that was the
option that was implemented---presumably because it required the least amount
of extra work on the part of the examiners (a 24h time limit with no other
changes would have trivialised many of the papers). The University did indeed
implement a "deemed to have deserved honours" (DDH) option, but nobody I know
took it up just because it was a bit dodgy. The PPE department also relaxed the
requirement for a First (only a 68.5 average needed with no requirement that
specific First papers), and introduced a safety net, dropping the two
lowest-scoring papers in the eventual classification calculation.

## Revising for Finals

Celine and I studied mainly in 59 until we got rumbled by the porters, after
which we decided to move to Liddell (where the porters are much more
accommodating).

I only started revision proper around the start of HT Vac. This was the main schedule:

- HTW7: (Mar 1--7): Started properly writing the Politics thesis (~0 words on
  1st March, 7000 words on 7th March)
- HTW8: (Mar 8--14): Kept plugging on with the thesis, but didn't make much progress
- HT Vac W1 (Mar 15--21): Kept plugging on the Politics thesis, started working on BEE
- HT Vac W2: Finished first draft of Politics thesis.
- HT Vac W3: Worked on both theses
- HT Vac W4: Started revising Macro and compiling Macro notes
- HT Vac W5 (Apr 12--18): Continued compiling Macro notes
- TTW0: Submitted theses, Macro PYPs
- TTW1: Micro
- TTW2: Micro, bit of QE
- TTW3: QE
- TTW4: QE, bit of Macro
- TTW5: Start of Finals (Three core papers)
- TTW6: Revise for Theopol, Game Theory
- TTW7: GT, revised and compiled notes for PolSoc

My time was mainly focused on my theses and Macro until Thursday TTW0, the 23rd
of April (the submission deadline). After that, there was exactly a month from
the start of Trinity term to the start of my exams (TTW5 Monday). This meant
that I basically had one month (and a bit) to revise six papers.

TTW1 and TTW2 was mainly devoted to Micro, with a bit of QE on the end, and
TTW3 and W4 QE, with a bit of Macro re-revision on the end.

I basically did *no* revision for Theopol, Game Theory and PolSoc whatsoever: I
started revising Theopol on the 1st of June (a Monday) for the first time since
Hilary last year, and then took the exam on the Saturday, June 6th. Then it was
three days of concentrated revision (~8h) for Game Theory on the Tuesday, June
9th. Then I really should have started on PolSoc, but I couldn't muster up any
energy until Wednesday, so I did one and a half days of PolSoc revision before
the final exams.

Some general thoughts before I delve into the specifics:

Theses are a bad deal overall (worst trade deal in the history of trade deals)
and take up so much of my time. To be clear, the act of working on a thesis is
well worth it and there were a lot of side-rewards (getting to know Nick and
Daryl and MGGG and so on), but *within* the system of the Oxford examinations
they are worth *much* less. You do much, much more work on a thesis compared to
a regular paper; I would estimate (at least) three times the amount of work for
my politics thesis compared to a regular politics module, and between two to
four times the time for BEE compared to a regular economics module. While I
don't regret doing either thesis *ex ante*, I regret taking BEE *ex post*. (The
thesis in politics was, all things considered---an excellent decision with
good outcomes). More on this later. Ironically, I thought that PolSoc and
Game Theory actually went the best despite the fact that I spent so little time
on either of them. 

## Thesis in Politics

The thesis has really come a long way from its beginnings in 2019. I wrote a
lot about the initial beginnings of my thesis in the [2019 in review
post](2019/07/19/2019-year-in-review.html), which was actually the semiannual
review conducted at the end of the second academic year. Looking back, I
started seriously thinking about my thesis in April 2019, and I submitted my
thesis on the 23rd of April, 2020. That's one entire year I've been working on
my thesis. And I haven't even taken breaks, because I was thinking hard about
my thesis even during the summer! This is one year of effort for one paper.

**This is insane**. I can't stress how raw of a deal this is wrt the Oxford
examination systems. Let's compare it to a difficult but fun course, Game
Theory. I spent around 10 hours a week on Game Theory (~2h lectures a week + 2h
tute + 5-6 hours writing the tute worksheet), so that's 80 hours during term
time, plus another 20 hours for revision (5 PYPs ~4h each), so that's 100 hours
in total. With that amount of effort it's "realistic" for me to expect a 78 (ex
ante, not ex post). And this was all fun and easy and quite brainless: attend
the lectures, do a nice and interesting problem sheet, and when it came to the
exams just do all the past year papers, which was also fun.

In contrast, I have spent more than 300 hours working on my thesis. The
following estimates are not that reliable but I've tried to be as accurate as
possible.

The literature review and idea exploration probably took me around 50 hours
(initial idea generation: ~5 hours, discussion with Jarel: 5 hours, discussions
with Tak Huen and reading Political Analysis: 10 hours, discussion with Bassel
and writing the code for that exploration: 15 hours, discussions with Filip and
trying to salvage the eventually unworkable idea: another 10 hours). None of
that made it in the final thesis, but it did get me to Eubank and Rodden.

Then I worked with Eubank and Rodden. That was easily another 50 hours.
Discussion with Andy + more idea generation: 10 hours. Emails back and forth +
hashing out the initial criticisms: 5 hours. Researching a way to generate
travel durations: 5 hours. Writing the code to generate travel durations: must
have been at least 25 hours.

Still not actually found the thrust of my actual thesis!  Had to come up with
the human compactness metric: at least 10 hours of thinking. Then writing the
code to calculate human compactness, different compactness measures,
optimising... : *at least* 30 hours. Then visualisation, plotting, writing and
rewriting first drafts, calculating the metrics, thinking about how to position
the paper, and so on.. took at least 30 hours. And finally writing the final
version (and editing) the actual paper took almost two weeks of concentrated
writing, which was another 40 hours.

And maybe (at the highest) I should hope for a 78.

## Behavioural and Experimental Economics

I didn't like BEE that much because 

## Macroeconomics

Spent the most time revising for this, which in hindsight is probably not that
smart? because it tends to be a low-variance subject.

## Microeconomics

Fucked this paper. Misread the game theory question in Part A. 

## Quantitative Economics

## Game Theory

Apart from doing the tutorial questions, I must have spent twenty-five
hours---at most---revising for this module. There wasn't really much to do.
Originally I wanted to learn everything properly (getting the definitions
absolutely bang-on clear and formal, and learning all the topics lectures
including bargaining, ESS, and auctions), but realised it wasn't worth it in
the end. And so I focused on my favourite/strongest topics: core game theory,
repeated games, sequential/perfect Bayesian equilibrium, and so on. I really
couldn't have expected it to go any better. I spent a couple of hours really
grokking PBEs and how to solve for them. Professor Munoz-Garcia's notes on a
[systematic procedure for finding
PBEs](https://felixmunozgarcia.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/procedure_to_find_pbes_june_20121.pdf)
was incredibly useful here. I also spent about an hour or two revising the rest
of the definitions such as rationalisability, mixed extensions of a NE, and so
on, but didn't put too much effort


pleasantly surprised to find that 

But as I was mo

The exam was definitely made more difficult by Peter Eso to compensate
