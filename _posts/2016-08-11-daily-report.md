title: Long-overdue update
---

Since the last time I posted many things have happened. We managed to go ahead
with the iDA pilot class (not entirely up to my expectations). The kids'
hackathon is now over. I am now one year older and have entered *gasp* the
twenties. 

Time seems to pass extremely quickly and I feel like I should be doing
more--much more--if I am to secure a scholarship. I can't help but feel
frustrated that the things I have to do are gated by other people. I can work at
a blistering pace but if I've to wait for others to get back to me this limits
what I can do.

Over the past few months I've also been doing things that I feel are not *so*
useful with respect to getting a scholarship and part of me wonders if I should 
even bother. There are things that I have chosen to put on hold (driving) 
but there is the matter of ACCA and I'm not
sure how much effort to devote to that. It would be excellent if I can finish
F1-F3 by the end of this year but at what cost? 

And of course hobbies such as ping-pong or 书法 and so on which I want to get
better at but am I getting anything out of it and is it sapping my time? At the 
risk of sounding like a broken record, anything that doesn't bring me closer to
getting the scholarship I want is (by definition) unproductive. 

I realise that not all the things I embark upon will bear fruit. (I briefly
harboured the hope that my WITS project could give me something but I am now 
convinced that the entire endeavour is otiose). But what else can I do apart
from cast the net wide and hope that something sticks? 

That wasn't a rhetorical question. I still maintain that the best way to get a
scholarship is to do one thing and do it extremely well. But what is this thing?
I am perfectly willing to devote my time and energy to
a cause as long as this cause will pop up and say, please devote your
time and energy to me and you will not be stonewalled by other people, and it
will be able to grow, and it will all be worthwhile. 

This futility has given me somewhat of a 野心 in the sense that I am now
unsure of what course to take. There is no doubt in my mind that Oxford is my
first choice but as the hope of getting a scholarship dwindles, I am now
considering second/third choices. I have told a friend that I intend to take the
BMAT with him and I am considering going into medicine because apparently law is
on the down and down. I am even considering going back into engineering (REP
seems quite attractive)... 

If I may leave modesty by the side for a while I believe I deserve a
scholarship. I think I have the drive to self-criticise and self-improve.
Largely this is borne by the deep-seated insecurity that I am simply not good
enough. I also have another advantage that others don't: I don't value my
personal time because I know that I am nowhere near disciplined enough to make
good use of it. Therefore, I am able to put in a lot of effort into doing
whatever the hell the organisation wants me to do. 

It is now the 11th of August and I had best start planning my after-work
timetable. Very soon I will have armoury duty to do and will (probably) not have
this luxury. For now, however, I must make full use of my time at home and not
waste it playing Hearthstone or watching Youtube videos or chatting to friends. 

The perennial feeling of not doing enough with my life has emerged yet again
and all I can do is try to salve it.

One year older, but just as lost.
