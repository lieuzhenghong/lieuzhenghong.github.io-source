# Introduction

In this post, I'll first report on new things that have happened since my last
[annual review](/2019/01/01/MT2018-report.html). These are, in rough chronological order:

- Cooked 滷肉飯 for ~150 people at the OUCS Chinese New Year Ball
- Hosted Judy in Oxford
- Cooked tau huay for OUAPS's food fair
- Finished HT 2018 (Macroeconomics, Theory of Politics)
- Visited Venla in Finland (many firsts: ice fishing, sauna, lying naked in the snow)
- Road trip in Romania with OG
- Returned to Singapore
- Practiced algorithmic problems
- Failed the Stripe technical interview
- Found a summer internship
- Broke up with Judy
- Found a place to rent in Surrey

# Overview of the past four months

I want to give special attention to the failures in my life. I generally
maintain a healthy optimism about my life and my future prospects. But I think
it's important to highlight my failures, both for myself and for readers of
this blog: firstly, because I want to be honest about why I failed, identify
areas of improvement, and chronicle whether I've been able to learn from my
mistakes and apply these lessons to future situations; secondly, because it
strikes me as dishonest, self-serving, and boastful to talk selectively about
my successes and not about my failures. I'm going to place the things that I
failed at front-and-center before talking about anything else.

## Broke up with Judy

I want to put this front and center, because it is the failure that hurts the most, and the one that fills me most with doubt.

Broadly speaking, I feel like I have my life dialed down. I know what needs to
be done to achieve academic/career/physical success. I have been lucky to find
academic work easy. The habits and traits I've cultivated over the years may
not be optimal, but they've been sufficient for me to do well in my studies
without too much effort or stress on my part.

While I haven't had much success in the job search, I have had the support of
my benefactor, Mrs Hauw. I am greatly indebted to her, all the way from
2015---when she agreed to let me teach Python to her kids, to 2017, when she
allowed me to intern at iGlobe, to 2019, where she got me an internship with
Inzura. And of course the advice she has given me over the years has been
invaluable. Lest I seem ungrateful, I am also incredibly thankful that IMDA has
given me a scholarship to study at Oxford, a job waiting for me, and a head
start to financial independence.

But the one thing I haven't been able to figure out is cultivating strong,
long-term personal relationships. 

**NB:** I had originally planned to write a post-mortem of why Judy and I broke
up here. But it turned out to be so long that I pushed it into a separate post
[here](/2019/06/23/breaking-up.html).

## Failed the Stripe technical interview

I spent two weeks preparing for the upcoming technical interview using Jeremy
Aguilon's [Ranking Interview Questions by Cram Score
list](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).
I initialised a GitHub repo
[here](https://github.com/lieuzhenghong/jeremy-aguilon-cram-list-solutions)
where I write down the time taken for each solution. I was very rusty when I
started, but luckily I'd remembered the algorithms in the MOOCs I took
(especially Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms course), and it was easy to recall the
algorithms I forgot (as I'd previously internalised the intuitions behind the
algorithms). Progress was promising---I was relearning C++ at a nice clip, and
my comfort level and time taken in solving the problems was improving.

Sadly the task given in the Stripe technical interview was to implement a
lexer/parser...in Python! I hadn't touched Python in about a year and had
completely forgot how to manipulate strings and dictionaries (which there were
a lot of). The task was easy (especially so as I had built something much more
complicated in the NAND to Tetris course); I was simply too slow.

Unsurprisingly, I received a rejection from Stripe soon after. This was a
bummer, but I don't regret the practice. However, I will have to consider
practicing in Python than in C++, because it's more versatile and the
probability of me being blindsided is lower. I will be using a lot of R and
Python for my upcoming thesis,

## Failed to turn a profit selling tau huay for OUAPS's food fair

The main reason for the failure, I believe, is 

I would call this a "qualified failure". Profit was never really the terminal goal


However, I am a bit sad that Jing Long's "last hurrah" with me ended not with a
bang, but with a whimper.

# Things that went rather well

## Hosted Judy in Oxford

## Finished HT 2018 (Macroeconomics, Theory of Politics)

## Cooked 滷肉飯 for ~150 people at the OUCS Chinese New Year Ball

## Visited Venla in Finland (many firsts: ice fishing, sauna, lying naked in the snow)

## Road trip in Romania with OG

## Practiced algorithmic problems

## Found a summer internship

# Plans for the summer

I have goals
i have things i want in life
i have attributes i want to cultivate
skills i want to learn

## Values and purpose
## Contribution and impact
## Location and tangibles
## Money and finances
## Career and work

Consider pivoting to data science/data analysis, consulting
## Health and fitness

Realise that I have very bad mobility, and horrendous internal shoulder rotation. This is without a doubt caused by my penchant for benching a lot and my aversion towards any sort of horizontal pulling exercise (rows and deadlifts). I still don't like deadlifts but I've been trying to row three times a week.

## Education and skill development
## Social life and relationships
## Emotions and well-being
## Character and identity
## Productivity and organisation
## Adventure and creativity
