# Overview of the past four months

I want to give special attention to the failures in my life. I generally
maintain a healthy optimism about my life and my future prospects. But I think
it's important to highlight my failures, both for myself and for readers of
this blog: firstly, because I want to be honest about why I failed, identify
areas of improvement, and chronicle whether I've been able to learn from my
mistakes and apply these lessons to future situations; secondly, because it
strikes me as dishonest, self-serving, and boastful to talk selectively about
my successes and not about my failures. I'm going to place the things that I
failed at front-and-center before talking about anything else.

## Broke up with Judy

I want to put this front and center, because it is the failure that hurts the most, and the one that fills me most with doubt.

Broadly speaking, I feel like I have my life dialed down. I know what needs to
be done to achieve academic/career/physical success. I have been lucky to find
academic work easy. The habits and traits I've cultivated over the years may
not be optimal, but they've been sufficient for me to do well in my studies
without too much effort or stress on my part.

While I haven't had much success in the job search, I have had the support of
my benefactor, Mrs Hauw. I am greatly indebted to her, all the way from
2015---when she agreed to let me teach Python to her kids, to 2017, when she
allowed me to intern at iGlobe, to 2019, where she got me an internship with
Inzura. And of course the advice she has given me over the years has been
invaluable. Lest I seem ungrateful, I am also incredibly thankful that IMDA has
given me a scholarship to study at Oxford, a job waiting for me, and a head
start to financial independence.

But the one thing I haven't been able to figure out is cultivating strong,
long-term personal relationships...

**NB:** I had originally planned to write a post-mortem of why Judy and I broke
up here. But it turned out to be so long that I pushed it into a separate post
[here](/2019/06/23/breaking-up.html).

## Failed the Stripe technical interview

I spent two weeks preparing for the upcoming technical interview using Jeremy
Aguilon's [Ranking Interview Questions by Cram Score
list](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).
I initialised a GitHub repo
[here](https://github.com/lieuzhenghong/jeremy-aguilon-cram-list-solutions)
where I write down the time taken for each solution. I was very rusty when I
started, but luckily I'd remembered the algorithms in the MOOCs I took
(especially Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms course), and it was easy to recall the
algorithms I forgot (as I'd previously internalised the intuitions behind the
algorithms). Progress was promising---I was relearning C++ at a nice clip, and
my comfort level and time taken in solving the problems was improving.

Sadly the task given in the Stripe technical interview was to implement a
lexer/parser...in Python! I hadn't touched Python in about a year and had
completely forgot how to manipulate strings and dictionaries (which there were
a lot of). The task was easy (especially so as I had built something much more
complicated in the NAND to Tetris course); I was simply too slow.

Unsurprisingly, I received a rejection from Stripe soon after. This was a
bummer, but I don't regret the practice. However, I will have to consider
practicing in Python than in C++, because it's more versatile and the
probability of me being blindsided is lower. I will be using a lot of R and
Python for my upcoming thesis,

## Failed to turn a profit selling tau huay for OUAPS's food fair

The main reason for the failure, I believe, is because we didn't choose the
right thing to sell. Jovin had a spreadsheet for vendors to declare what they'd
want to sell. Jing Long and I took a look and saw that many people had declared
savoury food, so we decided not to fight with them and make a dessert instead.
It turned out that everyone changed their mind because savoury food is *hard*;
people who went there were very hungry, and were not really in the mood for dessert

[insert photos here]

I would call this a "qualified failure". Profit was never really the terminal
goal. However, I am a bit sad that Jing Long's "last hurrah" with me ended not
with a bang, but with a whimper.

# Things that went rather well

## Hosted Judy in Oxford

For her last term in school Judy didn't have to stay on campus, so she decided
to visit me in Oxford and to see her Oxford friends again. We had a lot of fun:
I cooked many of her favourite foods like *soondubu jigae* and mango sticky
rice, and it was just a very nice, chill time. We didn't argue much (at all?)
either --- it was a very positive trip.

## Finished HT 2018 (Macroeconomics, Theory of Politics)

I didn't put so much effort into Macro and Theory; really was rather lazy this
term. I'll have to put in the effort to learn it properly during the summer.

## Cooked 滷肉飯 for ~150 people at the OUCS Chinese New Year Ball

This was super enjoyable. Jing Long and I had a much easier time here compared
to last year. This is because we were very strategic in choosing what to sell.
Last year when we sold chicken rice there was a lot of stuff that we had to
prepare separately (and serially): first, 20 whole chickens had to be sous
vided (in two batches) the night before. Then we had to take the chicken stock
from the whole chicken and use it to cook the rice (making sure to cut off the
excess skin from the whole chickens and fry it to render the fat first). Then
we had to make the chilli sauce. Then we had to chop a lot of slices of
cucumber and tomatoes. Then on the day itself we had so many things to arrange:
first, Jing Long needed to debone the chicken, get the meat out, smash into
little pieces. I had to scoop the rice and put the cucumber and tomatoes very
nicely on the plate, then put the chicken on and drizzle the sesame oil sauce,
then add chilli on the side and garnish with coriander. It was a lot of work,
which meant that we served plates very slowly.

Learning from the previous year's experience, we brainstormed for a long time
to choose a dish. We knew we wanted something that was one-pot, or as close to
it as possible, to minimise serving time. Ideally it would be something we
could prepare in advance. We also didn't want to do a Chinese Chinese dish: we
wanted to showcase Singaporean food.

We thought of many ideas: bak chor mee, wonton mee (too fussy -- noodles must
be cooked on the spot), oden (not a "dish"), pumpkin rice (not sexy enough),
laksa (cannot get the sea hum)... In the end, I had an epiphany and thought of
lor bak. It's just the right amount of foreign + familiar (this is a soupier,
saltier Teochew (?) version: the version most non Singaporeans will be familiar
with is a thicker, sweeter version made with minced pork).

In contrast, for 滷肉飯 there was not many steps: because all the ingredients
are in one bowl, really all that needs to be done is to just ladle it out. The
only thing Jing Long needed to do was to halve the eggs (easy) and chop the lor
bak into bite-sized pieces (much easier than deboning a chicken).

We decided early on to have "five treasures": braised pork belly, shitake
mushrooms, tau pok, tau kee and soy sauce egg. We wanted to have a large
variety of ingredients to make our food be more exciting and more
value-for-money.

On the day itself the ball was scheduled to start at 730 pm. But we were
already packing all our pots and pans and condiments at 130 pm. The soy sauce
eggs had to be marinated overnight, and took on a lovely dark brown colour.

Conveniently, the ball was held near Osney Mead, which meant that we could buy
some of the ingredients from the Meatmasters' nearby. This hugely reduced our
transportation burden. It also meant that we could get the butchers' to slice
the pork belly more thinly, which is critical if we want the pork belly to
become very tender.

![Meatmasters'](/img/lu_rou_fan/IMG_20190209_152029.jpg)

We bought 12kg of pork belly and 2kg of onions from the Meatmasters' just
across the street, then started cutting up the onions and searing the pork
belly. It turned out that everything *just about* fit---we could not possibly
have cooked any more. So 12kg of pork belly was exactly the right amount to buy.

Learning from our previous chicken rice experience, we actually calculated the
portion sizes: 200g white rice, 60g pork belly, 1/2 an egg, 1 tau pok, 1
mushroom, and Jing Long made sure to practice serving and plating several bowls
of that quantity to make it look the most attractive.

As people were almost about to come in, I realised belatedly that we had no
signage! The ball committee printed signages for their own internal stalls, but
not for us. Thinking quickly, I went to the calligraphy station and anyhowly
wrote a name for our store, "Five Treasures Braised Meat Rice".

The calligraphy is not very good, but it got the job done.

I had to change into my shirt and trousers because I was scheduled to perform
with OXCAR at the concert! I was very afraid that some of the 'zaap' would get
on my white shirt.

People really liked our food. Some complained that it was too expensive, but we
completely sold out, which means that it was not too expensive.

## Visited Venla in Finland (many firsts: ice fishing, sauna, lying naked in the snow)

Finland was incredibly beautiful.

## Road trip in Romania with OG

## Practiced algorithmic problems

I did a good job

## Found a summer internship

It irks me a little bit that I found an internship not strictly speaking
through my own ability, but through a recommendation of my ex-boss. But I
believe almost all jobs work this way---for instance, one gets into Google not
by sending in one's resume, but by getting a referral from someone who's
already inside.
