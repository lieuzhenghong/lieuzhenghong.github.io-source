## daily report for 2016-04-24

Today I woke up at 7am to because I had to be at Ulu Pandan at 9am. In
retrospect it wasn't necessary--I got in the car at 830 am and was there by 845.

After the lesson I took the bus to Bukit Timah, had duck rice for lunch, then
gave my second lesson. She gave me $270 for the previous three lessons. Shiok. 

I think I'll keep to this arrangement because it leaves my weekdays free and I
don't have to go all the way to Tampines. It's great--I pull in a cool 170$ a
day. That's $680 a month!

My mother actually has another lobang--this Sec 2 hwachong guy who wants to be
taught maths--but 2 is good enough for me (although if i take him on, 260 a
month is over 1k...shiok leh)

Programming wise, I was going to learn socket.io, but then I decided to start
with learning databases first. So I installed MongoDB and made a sign-up sheet.
It's obviously broken and totally unsafe but basically it sends a GET request of
your email, name and password (in plain text!!!); ExpressJS's router parses it
and adds it to the `users` database in MongoDB. 

This weekend has been pretty productive. I learned a lot of programming and
luckily I've not been stuck with the config. This week I learned (the very
basics of) the following: 

1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB
4. Vim
5. Terminal commands (can you believe I had no idea what pwd was?)
6. Jekyll
7. Homebrew

Lots of stuff! Next week I want to learn/do the following:

1. Build an actual login page
2. Learn socket.io and do a chat app or some simple game that uses websockets
3. Keep up with my current commitments--these are:
    1. Complete the ACCA F1 textbook
    2. Learn how to play the complete song--critical, no more time left
    3. Keep going to the gym/swimming three times a week

Alright off to bed. 23:10 right now.
