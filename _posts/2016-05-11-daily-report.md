title: Meeting with iDA staff (Oscar, Kiranjit and Eric)
---

I'm ~~on the train now on my way back to Bukit Panjang~~ in BPP library. 
After this I'm going to have a meeting with Khek CO.

I visited Oscar and his bunch of colleagues at iDA. I reached the office at 4pm
and Oscar came down to fetch me. The office is super nice, it really looks like
a tech company, I saw people in the basement hacking and coding and stuff. The
view is also extremely chio. I told Oscar that his office was very nice and he
told me that Google/Facebook offices are even nicer--they have hammocks and beer
taps(!!). So maybe we want to consider a career in tech. Haha. 

In any case, I was introduced to Oscar, Kiranjit and Eric. Oscar is this short
fat guy whose reservist unit is the same as my unit, lol (2CSH) He's a super
nice guy, very boisterous. Keranjit is
this Indian woman who I think is the most passionate and eloquent. Eric is a
quiet guy, didn't talk much, he used to work in education. Very
logistics-focused. He told me that he could ask companies and schools to give us
resources. 

They complimented me on my proposal and said that I might even consider selling
my training programme syllabus to companies because it's so good. I'm not sure 
how much of it was flattery and how much of it was genuine. But from the fact that they all
concurred it must have been pretty good. 

All hubris aside, this is a learning
point. It was a good move to put so much time in the proposal because it
obviously made an impression on them which is why they were so willing to meet me.
So in the future, lesson learned--**spend a lot of time on one's proposal.**

I also learned that after I emailed Dr Balakrishnan, my email was actually 
passed around to several ministries before it finally landed in the iDA's hands.
Glad that it finally came here--a minister's word means a lot, evidently. Once
again, lesson learned--**don't be afraid to ask for what you want**. 

I told them about Ulu Pandan Stars and they were extremely impressed. Keranjit
in particular--she was extremely happy when I told her that the underprivileged
kids actually won last year's hackathon. Of course, I made sure to say that it
wasn't me. But it was good to have the backing of Ulu Pandan Stars and I told
them that I was teaching them for this year's competition. 

They were very friendly and eager to work with me. They told me that there were
a couple of other guys that had the same idea and that they wanted to form a
committee. Of course I am okay with that--even though one has to share credit,
a better outcome is better for all of us. 

They expressed their reservations about my proposal, saying that it could be too
ambitious and too hard for first-timers with no prior programming experience.
After discussion, I finally have a *concrete plan of action.* There is this
group called the Youth Infocomm Ambassadors (YIA) which is representatives from
secondary schools' infocomm clubs. They told me that we could run my syllabus on
them, as a pilot test, see if the pace is OK, then iterate and improve. 

I think the best part of working with the iDA is that they are extremely
powerful and well-connected. Oscar, Keranjit and Eric told me casually that they
could get a venue no problem, probably get computers from companies like Apple
and Samsung... they have the power to solve my logistics problems *just like
that*. 

It was emphasised to me that they want this to be a *community project*. Their
purpose is to help foster a coding community that imparts knowledge to society.
The idea is for this community to extend iDA's current school-based initiative,
as well as teach groups not covered by the schools (e.g. working adults, seniors
and so on). They told me multiple times that they **will** pull strings to get
us media coverage but they will not put iDA on it. Hence they won't steal the
credit (their words, not mine). To me, it doesn't matter whether iDA is on the
papers or not, but I think it matters to them. They don't want people to think
that it's iDA doing this. 

We all came out of the meeting with a plan of action. My job now is
to think about my syllabus further, and **recruit several volunteers**. Their
job will be to form up the committee and liaise with YIA so that we can set up
our pilot class.

All in all, an extremely useful visit and I greatly enjoyed myself. I'm
extremely optimistic on where this will go, and I loved talking to them. They
were friendly and passionate--not at all the reception I had expected from a
cold email to Dr Vivian! 

## Call to action ##
Whoever is reading this, please note that as of the time of writing (11th May
2016) I am looking for volunteers to teach Scratch/Python! 

The time commitment will not be over a few weeks. (so not one-year long, but if
the pilot programme works, then it would be great to have you on). 

I will train the volunteers--programming knowledge is preferred but not necessary. 
What *is* necessary is the ability to pick things up fast and the ability to 
teach others. 

So please ask around for me ty.
