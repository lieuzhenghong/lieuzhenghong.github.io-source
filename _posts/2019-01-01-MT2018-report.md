# Introduction

In this post, I'll first report on new things that have happened since my last
[annual review](2018-07-01-2018-in-review.md). These are: I completed my
internship at IMDA, finished MT 2018 (Microeconomics and Political Sociology),
and am on a month-long trip to the US. I'll take stock of my personal
development since the last annual review. Finally, I'll lay out plans for the
New Year and set some New Year's resolutions.

# Overview of last year

In a departure from my previous posts, I want to give special attention to the
failures in my life. I generally maintain a healthy optimism about my life and
my future prospects. But I think it's important to highlight my failures, both
for myself and for readers of this blog: firstly, because I want to be honest
about why I failed, identify areas of improvement, and chronicle whether I've
been able to learn from my mistakes and apply these lessons to future
situations; secondly, because it
strikes me as dishonest to talk selectively about my successes and not about my
failures. I'm going to place the things that I failed at front-and-center
before talking about anything else.

# Things that went badly

## Did badly for prelims

With a 73/69/52 (Philosophy/Politics/Economics), I failed to get the 200
required for a Distinction in the Prelims.

This was due to very poor performance in the Economics prelims. Largely due to
poor question selection. I had prepared extensively for the prelims, doing all
the past-year papers that were available to me on Weblearn, and consulting with
my graduate mentors. I was well prepared for the exam. Unfortunately, I chose
the first question which involved a kinked demand curve, did not realise it
was kinked, and thus completely bungled the entire question, which had knock-on
effects on the rest of the paper.

My choosing the wrong question can be boiled down to hubris. Generally,
questions on demand tend to involve very little explanation and writing. The
alternative was to do a question on downstream monopoly, where the analysis is
easy but you have to write quite a lot. I chose the question on demand because
I was aiming to get a 80 on that question. But this strategy was high-variance
and I failed.

It would have been much smarter to take the lower-variance question,
particularly in such a high-stakes exam. This is a lesson well learned,
thankfully in Prelims rather than in FHS.

Despite my poor performance in Econs, I am very happy with my performance in
Philosophy and Politics. In Philosophy I placed in the 99th percentile with
a score of 73. Two people outscored me with a score of 75. This was due to my
extensive preparation on Logic, in particular the Natural Deduction section,
which allowed me to score a 77 on question 4 (just shy of a perfect score), and
an overall score of 76 in the logic section. 

I also wrote a First-class essay (72) on moral responsibility ("Moral
responsibility solely depends on what actually happened, not on what could have
happened"), in which I gave an argument delineating being *physically* free to
perform an action vs being *mentally* free, and argued that Frankfurt's "higher
order volition" account gives us a good starting point to ascribe moral
responsibility.  I wrote a competent essay (69) on Mill's conception of higher
and lower pleasures, in which I gave an argument I had thought about
extensively about the arbitariness (and circularity) of trying to define higher
and lower pleasures.

In Politics I placed in the 86th percentile with a score of 69, which I am also
happy with. I wrote First-class essays (73) on paternalism ("Is it permissible
for the state to make pleasurable drugs illegal?")---where I used Berlin's
conception of positive and negative freedoms, then Dworkin's defense of
paternalism on the grounds that taking addictive drugs restricts one's positive
liberties---and party attachments ("Why are party attachments in decline")
(dealignment due to industrialisation and cognitive mobilisation).
I wrote a competent (68) essay on democracy ("Does a country require anything
more than competitive elections to be democratic?") (yes, but it depends).  However, I scored a 62
for "Should civic engagement be discouraged?", which is surprising, as
I thought that essay was well-written.

Overall, I prepared enough for my Prelims, and was let down not by inadequate
preparation but by hubris leading to poor question selection. I will be more
humble in the future, preferring low-variance questions especially in my
next exam, which will be make-or-break..

## Rejected from big companies for technical internships

As part of my plan to get a software engineering internship, I sent in my
resume to all the usual suspects and got nothing but rejection.

This is a bit problematic as I don't know which one of the (many) things is
blocking me. It could be my nationality (not a US citizen: require visa
sponsorship), my choice of degree or my resume.

## Failed my first technical interview

Due to the fact that I 

A persistent problem is that while in Oxford, I don't have much time to
practice my coding.

# Things that went well

## IMDA internship

As part of the terms of my scholarship contract I am obligated to do two
eight-week internships with IMDA. I managed to compress them both into one
summer.

I absolutely loved this internship. It was largely self-directed. I was able
to explore the different types of blockchain, implement an instance of
a Hyperledger blockchain, then build a fully-automated, 60cm by 120cm diorama
(with a model train, trees/water/rocks/doodads, a Raspberry Pi and
a DigitalOcean server) that showed a "real-world" application of the blockchain. [^1]

[^1]: I pledge to write up a blog post about this internship project by 31st January 2019.

## Algorithms self-study

I worked through the Coursera [**Algorithms Specialisation**]() taught by Tim
Roughgarden from Stanford.

I also worked through [*Competitive Programmer's Core Skills*]() offered by
...

The Algorithms specialisation was great: thanks to Professor Roughgarden,
I learned many "greatest hits" such as quicksort, Dijkstra's, Knapsack, 2SAT
and TSP. The "algorithmic toolbox" techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic
programming, reducing-to-graph-search and heuristic approaches to NP-complete
problems were also incredibly enlightening. I uploaded my solutions to the
problems [on Github]().

This was the hardest course I have taken on Coursera. If I were to rank the
courses I have taken by difficulty, it would be as follows:

1. Algorithms Specialisation
2. N2T II
3. Machine Learning
4. Rest of the courses

## Political Sociology

> ZhengHong has performed at the highest possible level in this module. His
> coverage and understanding of the materials, his committed attitude, his
> constant improvement on the econometric side of the paper, and the quality of
> his written work were First class. ZhengHong is planning to write a thesis on
> quantitative political science topic, so the effort he made in Pol Soc will
> be very helpful later on. Two things concern me, though, at this point.
> First, the level of nuance and sophistication that ZhengHong is able to show
> in his tutorial essays will be difficult to replicate in an exam setting. He
> will need to practice exam writing under timed conditions (at home and in
> Collections), and learn how to be more selective in his arguments and
> critical engagement with the literature. Second, I hear from Economics that
> the extra effort he put into Pol Soc came at the cost of investing in
> Microeconomics. Zhenghong should remember that all papers need to be mastered
> in order to get a First, and that, as he very well knows, technical papers
> are not necessarily always the most straightforward.

- What is the most important problem here?
- What is my biggest bottleneck?
- What is most holding me back from achieving my full potential?
- What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact
  here?

## Values & Purpose

"Your deeper, underlying, fundamental values and wants. Your philosophy of
life. Your sense of purpose, vision and meaning."

- What do I want out of life?
- How do I want the world to be different?
- What is my philosophy of life?
- What are my fundamental values?
- What do I truly value?

## Contribution & Impact

"How you give value to the world, make a difference, and have a positive
impact."

- How am I giving value to the world? How much value?
- How much money did I give away in the past year?

## Location & Tangibles

"Your physical presence in the world. Where you are in the world. Your living
situation. Your stuff. What you own and why. Your material sufficiency. Your
mobility."

My physical presence in the world is constrained by my circumstance. But Oxford
is an absolutely wonderful place to be in.

My living situation is good. I'm happy to be living with Oskar and Rayhan but
I hope that they will be spending more time in their rooms instead of being at
Richard's.

I don't own much stuff, but a lot of cooking stuff. Cooking is something
I derive lots of joy from.

## Money & Finances

In 2018, IMDA gave me a $29,000 living allowance and in 2017, IMDA gave me
a $9,400 living allowance and a $2,800 one-time settling allowance. This is
pegged to PSC rates so I basically get ~14k per 6 months.

At the moment, I have no money in my Singapore bank account, but 6000 pounds in
my GBP account. This is meant for the following three terms: HT 2019, TT 2019
and MT 2019.

I have not allocated any money for the vacation terms:  I suspect I'll spend
a lot of money during some vacations, and very little during the others.

I have 30 days of vac res.

This vacation, I've spent 2000 pounds on my month-long US trip.



I have been able to save $15,000.


## Career & Work

Scholarship is going well, internship finished.

Now need to find a summer internship but that hasn't been going so well as
mentioned.

## Health & Fitness

This year hasn't been good for that.

No good because I got a girlfriend, then preparing for Prelims, then IMDA
internship, then moving to Hollywell 59.

Habits are very important here so it's important to start cultivating automatic
habits.

Going to the gym every day is a good example.

My sleep schedule is not good. It tends to drift later and later due to akrasia
and hyperbolic discounting.

Do I want to boulder with Sihong? Or too far?

## Education & Skill Development

Didn't go to lectures. 

Did well by starting a flashcard habit for PolSoc.

Can do better by starting a flashcard habit for Micro.

Next term also do flashcards for TheoPol and Macro.

## Social Life & Relationships

Being in Hollywell 59 generally being lazy.

## Emotions & Well-being

"Your general feeling about life, optimism or pessimism, positivity or
negativity. Your emotional intelligence. Your subjective well-being,
self-esteem, self-respect, and self-compassion."

## Character & Identity

"Your identity and model of yourself. Your strengths and weaknesses, virtues
and vices. Your intelligence, integrity, honesty, courage, compassion, honour,
self discipline, and so on."

## Productvity & Organisation

## Adventure & Creativity

OXCAR i am very bad. Need to learn how to sight read and how to sing intervals.

Interval training---never kept up the habit. How can I inculcate that properly
into my daily routine.

Start practicing piano?

Do I want to do ballroom dancing with Roseanna?
