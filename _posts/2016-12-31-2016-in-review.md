2016 has been a long year and it's hard to keep track of all the things I've
done. I started this blog (I think it's more of a diary really) for the express
purpose of keeping track of what I have been doing.

## Calendar of events 2016 ##

This diary/blog has been a great help in remembering the things that I've done
this past year.

## Things I have succeeded at ##

This year I've focused on improving my technical skill. I feel that I have
learned a lot but there's still *a lot* to learn.

My focus this year has been on the Web and I don't think that's a bad thing *per se*
because the Web is so ubiquitous after all. However,
but after taking CS50 and doing some C, I realise that it can be a lot of fun. I
think I want to move away from building websites as it has become somewhat trivial
with the advent of excellent front-end frameworks like Bootstrap. 

I still enjoy
game and app development and am likely to continue pursuing it in the future but 
after dipping my toes in CS50 I think I would like to explore the more technical/
computer science aspect of development. That means machine learning/NN/AI instead
of web development. 

I will run through this year's projects each in turn:

### CodeGL, or a failed Shenzhen I/O knockoff ###

Although this project has not been touched for more than a month, I feel comfortable
putting

## Things I have failed at ##

### Going to the gym consistently ###
### ACCA ###
### Learning to swim ###
### Learning to drive ###

## Things that are neither here nor there ##
