## Lieu Zheng Hong (or Zhenghong Lieu)

I am currently reading Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Merton College,
and am interested in game theory, computational political science, Bayesian
inference, and distributed computing. My resume can be found at [this very
site](https://lieuzhenghong.com/resume).

My interests are capricious but the ones I always come back to include
programming, eating, cooking and lifting weights.

I am interested in exploring the following topics and have idiosyncratic
views regarding them: embryonic genetic selection for human betterment,
financial planning for early retirement, and optimising what and how I eat to
maximise health and fitness.

<p>I use this page as a personal diary. In it I record my thoughts and
feelings, my views and goals, my struggles and triumphs. I like looking at my
old posts and see how I have changed. I particularly enjoy reading the problems
that faced me in the past and seeing how they were overcome (or not).</p>
