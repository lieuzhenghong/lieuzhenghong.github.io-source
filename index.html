<h2>Lieu Zheng Hong (or Zhenghong Lieu)</h2>

<p>I am currently reading Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Merton College,
and am interested in game theory, computational political science, Bayesian
inference, and distributed computing. My resume can be found at <a href="http://www.lieuzhenghong.com/resume">this very site</a>.</p>

<p>My interests are capricious but the ones I always come back to include
programming, eating, cooking and lifting weights.</p>

<p>I am interested in exploring the following topics and have idiosyncratic
views regarding them: embryonic genetic selection for human betterment,
financial planning for early retirement, and optimising what and how I eat to
maximise health and fitness.</p>

<p>I use this page as a personal diary. In it I record my thoughts and
feelings, my views and goals, my struggles and triumphs. I like looking at my
old posts and see how I have changed. I particularly enjoy reading the problems
that faced me in the past and seeing how they were overcome (or not).</p>
