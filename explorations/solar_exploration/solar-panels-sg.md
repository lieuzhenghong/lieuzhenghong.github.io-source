title: How many solar panels would be needed to 100% solar-power Singapore?
---

**Principal investigators: Michael and Celine**

## Summary

We use horizontal irradiance data, Singapore's half-hourly power demand
statistics and solar panel schematics to calculate the area of solar panels
(and battery storage) needed to meet Singapore's energy demands. We
calculate that an area of **16,800 hectares** would be needed.

I am very uncertain in this calculation and I am certain that I have missed
something.

Thanks very much to Michael and Celine for researching this problem with me:
whatever errors remain are mine.
